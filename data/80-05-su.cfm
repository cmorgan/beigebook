         <p>
          Economic activity slowed markedly across the country according to 
this month's district reports. Led by a sharp falloff in automobile 
sales, consumer spending has weakened substantially. There is 
evidence of a contraction in sales of other durable goods as well as 
of nondurables. The outlook outside the consumer sector was 
generally pessimistic as well. Residential construction has ground 
to a virtual halt, although nonresidential building remained brisk 
in several districts. With a few notable exceptions, mainly the 
defense, energy and machine tool industries, a wide cross section of 
manufacturing firms reduced their workforces in the face of 
declining new orders, shrinking backlogs and rising inventories. 
Many firms also began to reassess capital spending plans, but other 
than in the auto industry, there has been little actual retrenchment 
thus far. On the financial scene, despite lower interest rates, 
business and consumer loan activity remained dormant. Agricultural 
loan demand, however, rose about in line with past seasonal 
patterns.
         </p>
         <p>
          Consumer spending weakened across the nation in April. While the 
largest cutbacks continued to be in big-ticket durable items 
especially autos, purchases of nondurable goods also slackened. As a 
result, there were reports of excessive retail inventories in 
several districts. In the Chicago area, where demand was 
particularly depressed, merchants offered large price reductions and 
discount programs to trim accumulating stocks. In contrast, 
inventory-sales ratios were reported as acceptable in both 
Philadelphia and New York. Auto stocks were generally lean. 
Nevertheless, many dealerships have gone out of business in the 
Atlanta, Dallas and San Francisco regions. Declining consumer credit 
card usage nationwide contributed importantly to weakening demand. 
Existing credit balances were significantly reduced according to 
Atlanta and Richmond, and new credit purchases were down as much as 
20 percent from last April in Dallas with cash buying, as evidenced 
in the weak growth in currency nationally, not taking up the slack. 
Slower debt collection and bill payments were noted in Philadelphia, 
Chicago and San Francisco.
         </p>
         <p>
          Outside the consumer sector, overall business conditions 
deteriorated in recent weeks. Backlogs were worked down, as new 
orders declined and lead times were shortened in a variety of 
industries ranging from steel in Cleveland and Chicago, to furniture 
and floor covering in Boston, to chemicals and electronic supplies 
in New York. Inventory liquidation was reported in Philadelphia, 
Chicago and Kansas City although excessive stocks are not yet a 
problem for New York manufacturers. As a result of decreased 
production activity, workweeks were shortened in Richmond, 
Philadelphia and Chicago, and layoffs—both temporary and permanent—have spread. Both hourly and salaried employees have been dismissed 
in the automobile and related industries in the Chicago and 
Cleveland areas, while workers in homebuilding and construction 
industries have been particularly hard hit in Atlanta and San 
Francisco. Reassessments of capital investment plans were underway 
by firms in Boston, New York and St. Louis, but little actual 
retrenchment has taken place except in the auto industry. As with 
auto employment, these cutbacks have been concentrated in the 
nation's midsection. Input prices continued to rise in Philadelphia 
and Kansas City although metals, lumber and paper prices have all 
softened in the Boston district.
         </p>
         <p>
          In contrast to these generally bleak conditions, machine tool 
manufacturers in New York and Cleveland appear relatively insulated 
from the recession. In Boston, Dallas, San Francisco and St. Louis 
the manufacturing base has been strengthened by the defense 
industry. In Minneapolis, defense procurement contracts have grown 
by 30 percent in the last two years.
         </p>
         <p>
          Residential construction continued to stagnate with activity at a 
virtual standstill in Atlanta, Cleveland and St. Louis. Housing 
starts are 50 percent below last year in Kansas City. Industries 
related to home building have also been especially depressed. The 
plywood industry in San Francisco has been operating at less than 
half capacity. Estimated joblessness in construction and related 
industries ranged between 20 and 40 percent in Chicago. At major 
lumber and plywood mills in the San Francisco district, one-sixth or 
more of the workers have been furloughed. Nonresidential building, 
however, remained brisk in Minneapolis, St. Louis and San Francisco.
         </p>
         <p>
          Reflecting weakening loan demand across the nation, short- term 
interest rates declined sharply. Still, relatively high interest 
rates and growing economic uncertainty continued to discourage 
business and consumer borrowers alike. Moreover, nonprice lending 
terms were tightened in Kansas City, New York and San Francisco. 
Business loan demand eased in all districts although demand by 
energy industries remained strong in Dallas. New York reported some 
companies shifted to the long-term bond and commercial paper markets 
to meet credit needs. Although home mortgage rates are well below 
recent peaks, little activity was noted in Kansas City or Cleveland 
although in Chicago and St. Louis, a few loans were made. In 
Atlanta, a surge in personal bankruptcies was noted. Auto 
installment loans were especially weak in Richmond.
         </p>
         <p>
          Agricultural loan demand rose seasonally but this sector, as others, 
was affected by comparatively high interest rates and escalating 
uncertainty. Some bankers are concerned about repayment ability 
because of generally rising agricultural costs and declining prices 
for food. Farm credit was tight in Chicago but adequate in Atlanta, 
Dallas and Richmond. Slower repayments and increased renewals and 
extensions, however, became common in Richmond, while in Chicago 
many farmers restricted purchases, especially of equipment, in order 
to ease their credit needs.
