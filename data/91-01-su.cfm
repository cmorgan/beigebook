           The level of economic activity appears to be declining in most 
districts. The Persian Gulf situation is frequently cited as a key 
determinant of both current and future economic activity. Nominal 
retail sales during the holiday season differed little from a year 
earlier. Inventories are near their desired levels. Despite 
continued export growth, manufacturing orders, employment and 
shipments have weakened. Construction activity continues to slow in 
most districts, and interest rate declines have done little to 
stimulate residential housing demand Inflation does not appear to be 
accelerating. Widespread weakness exists in home sales and consumer 
and business loan demand. Some state and local governments are 
experiencing revenue shortfalls. Farm income prospects have weakened 
somewhat, while the mining sector shows strength.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Consumer Spending
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Nominal retail sales during the holiday season were near year-
earlier levels, implying declines in real terms. Sales of big-ticket 
items were particularly weak. Boston, New York, Philadelphia, 
Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis and Dallas mention that 
price discounting was used to move goods. Despite the reported 
dampening effect of the Persian Gulf conflict throughout the holiday 
season, some Districts noted improved sales toward the end of 
December. Most districts that mention inventories report they are 
generally near desired levels. The outlook for retail sales in most 
districts is for continued sluggishness, with retailers in 
Philadelphia and Cleveland not expecting any upturn before the third 
quarter of this year.
          </p>
          <p>
           Four districts indicate that car sales are weakening or lower than a 
year earlier while Dallas indicates increasing sales, especially in 
the Houston area. Auto inventories are moderate to high in the 
Minneapolis district, while Kansas City reports that dealers are 
trimming their inventories. Cleveland indicates that domestic car 
dealers are not adding to their inventories, in contrast to their 
Japanese counterparts who are increasing inventories in anticipation 
of higher spring sales.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Manufacturing
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Nearly all districts report weak or declining manufacturing 
activity. While domestic demand is generally weakening, Boston, 
Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas and San Francisco 
indicate that export growth continues to be strong, or at least 
stronger than domestic growth. Cleveland, Chicago and St. Louis note 
a downturn in auto production that had spread to related sectors. 
Cleveland and Chicago, for example, note sharp declines in steel 
production. Boston and St. Louis report that layoffs are expected 
among defense contractors, and San Francisco reports that defense-
related aerospace activity remains weak. The outlook for the 
manufacturing sector is clouded by the Persian Gulf situation, with 
some districts indicating that the timing of an upturn is dependent 
on a resolution of that conflict. Contacts in the Boston, 
Philadelphia, Richmond and Dallas districts, however, do not expect 
a turnaround before the third quarter.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Construction and Real Estate
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Despite pockets of strength, most districts describe residential and 
nonresidential construction activity as down more than usual for 
this time of year. Housing starts are below year-ago levels in most 
districts, and high and climbing vacancy rates in many large urban 
areas have discouraged commercial office space development. Contacts 
in the Dallas district, however, report a modest increase in 
construction activity, especially in Houston and South Texas. Recent 
declines in interest rates and home prices have done little to buoy 
demand for new or existing homes in most districts. Contacts cite 
uncertainty about the future course of economic activity and the 
Persian Gulf crisis as the major factors dampening residential 
housing demand. New York reports that some district lenders and 
developers have held auctions to pare housing inventories.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Prices
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Several districts report little evidence of increasing inflation. 
San Francisco reports that wage and price increases continue to 
slow, and Minneapolis notes that they have remained moderate. 
Cleveland contacts expect the inflation rate to decline from recent 
levels. Manufacturing input and output prices are generally stable, 
although Richmond reports increased raw materials prices. Districts 
report declining oil and natural gas prices, but mixed movements in 
motor fuel prices. Grain prices are generally falling, while beef, 
citrus and log prices are showing strength.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Banking and Finance
           </strong>
           <br/>
           The majority of districts report weakness in business and consumer 
loan demand, largely due to the slowdown in the economy and the 
Persian Gulf. Real estate lending is edging downward in many 
districts, despite declines in mortgage interest rates. Commercial 
real estate and construction lending are especially weak. Atlanta 
reports that many businesses have reduced or delayed planned capital 
expenditures. Cleveland notes that signs of consumer financial 
difficulties are emerging, as evidenced by increases in auto 
repossessions and home foreclosures in some parts of the district.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            State and Local Government Finance
           </strong>
           <br/>
           State and local governments in the New York, Richmond, St. Louis and 
Dallas districts are either expecting or experiencing revenue 
shortfalls because of weakening economic conditions. In some cases, 
increased government spending was also cited as contributing to the 
governments' financial strain. A variety of measures, including 
reduced spending and layoffs, are being taken or are anticipated to 
avoid budget deficits.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Agriculture and Natural-Resource-Related Industries
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Kansas City and Richmond indicate that farm income prospects for 
1991 have dimmed because of an expected cost-price squeeze. Chicago 
notes that agricultural exports have fallen sharply in recent 
months. A recent freeze and a continuing drought are causing major 
problems for California's agricultural sector. Winter grain crops 
are reported to be in good condition, although Minneapolis notes 
potential problems later this year because of below-normal 
precipitation this winter.
          </p>
          <p>
           Energy extraction has increased in the Dallas and St. Louis 
districts, while Kansas City indicates that growth in the number of 
operating drilling rigs has leveled off. Minneapolis reports that 
conditions in the mining industry have been fairly good. San 
Francisco, St. Louis and Atlanta report weak or declining activity 
in the forest products industries.
