            Overview
           </strong>
           <br/>
           District reports are nearly uniform in the suggestion that an 
economic recovery began shortly after the first of the year. In most 
areas the recovery is being led, in many cases exclusively, by 
personal consumption expenditures and residential real estate sales 
and construction. Automobile sales are generally improved relative 
to year earlier levels, but are not consistently sustaining the 
levels reached in January of this year. The manufacturing sector 
remains spotty. Housing and auto related industries are improving. 
Capital goods, on the other hand, remain severely depressed in most 
areas. Inventories are generally characterized as light to moderate 
but there is no clear pattern of intentions with respect to changes 
over the near term. Despite the improvement in business activity the 
employment picture seems to have improved little, if at all. Banks 
and thrifts continued to experience strong deposit inflows, 
primarily into MMDAs. Loan activity is essentially flat with modest 
gains in real estate and consumer lending about offsetting declines 
in business loans.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            The Manufacturing Sector
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Manufacturing activity is mixed both nationally and in most 
districts. Generally speaking, consumer, automobile, and housing 
related industries are showing marked signs of recovery. Building 
materials, in particular, are buoyant and upward pressures on their 
prices are developing.
          </p>
          <p>
           Minneapolis, Dallas, and San Francisco all indicated that their 
lumber and forest products industries are strengthening. Chicago 
reports some gypsum plants operating six days a week with output 
above rated capacity. In the Boston District, housing activity is 
boosting production of roofing materials, building parts, wiring, 
electrical devices, and appliances.
          </p>
          <p>
           In the Philadelphia and Richmond Districts the strength in 
manufacturing activity is more broadly based. New orders and 
shipments have zoomed according to Philadelphia, while in Richmond's 
area there has been broad improvement in shipments, orders, and 
order backlogs.
          </p>
          <p>
           In other areas developments are less encouraging. Cleveland notes 
little change on balance, although steel orders are responding to 
increased auto production. Mills are operating at 50 percent of 
capacity as compared to 30 percent some months ago, and the price of 
scrap is up sharply. Industrial production remains depressed in the 
St. Louis District where several large plant closings are reported. 
Energy related industries also remain weak, and in Chicago's words, 
"machine tool order backlogs have evaporated."
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Consumer Spending
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Consumer spending appears to be strengthening on balance, but the 
improvement is spotty, both across districts and across the various 
segments of the retail sector. The relatively robust sales of 
January have moderated, in some areas because of extreme weather 
conditions. The composition of sales also varies from district to 
district. Soft goods, particularly apparel, seem to be doing well 
generally. Activity in durable goods is less consistent. Only 
Richmond, Atlanta, Dallas, and San Francisco specifically note 
strength in big ticket items. New York, on the other hand, reports 
that big ticket items remain weak.
          </p>
          <p>
           Retailers' inventories are modest to trim over all, but there 
appears to be no widespread tendency or intention to add to them. 
Atlanta sees stocks at department stores on the rise, responding to 
brisk sales. Boston characterizes inventories as high but 
satisfactory.
          </p>
          <p>
           New car sales, although up from recent levels, are still below 
expectations. Nonetheless, they are sufficient to have fostered some 
optimism and have encouraged production among suppliers, with the 
notable exception of tire manufacturers.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Construction and Real Estate
           </strong>
           <br/>
           The most consistent and widespread source of strength is the 
residential real estate sector. Sales of existing houses are up 
sharply in most areas. Construction of new structures is beginning 
to follow, and information on applications for and issuance of 
building permits suggests further progress in coming months. In the 
Minneapolis metropolitan area, home sales for the first two months 
of 1983 were up 34% from a year earlier, while in the San Francisco 
District housing starts are running at twice the level of the 
comparable period in 1982. Kansas City describes the situation there 
as a boom in housing starts.
          </p>
          <p>
           Commercial and industrial construction, however, is pervasively weak 
and, in many areas, is slowing. Only St. Louis specifically notes 
any strength in non-residential construction.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Banking and Finance
           </strong>
           <br/>
           There has been little tendency to date for loan demand to respond to 
the gains in economic activity. Modest and scattered strength in 
real estate and consumer lending is offset by continued weakness in 
business lending. Even consumer lending by banks and thrifts does 
not appear to have matched the gains in consumption expenditures. It 
is conjectured that captive finance companies may be handling some 
of the new car financing. The low level of business lending is 
attributed to sounder financial positions rather than to reduced 
business activity.
          </p>
          <p>
           Banks and thrifts are continuing to experience heavy inflows of 
funds into MMDAs. Kansas City suggests that other classes of 
deposits are actually declining, but that MMDA growth is so strong 
that it is holding the growth of total deposits up. There are 
indications from several areas that institutions are coming under 
increased pressure to find outlets for these new funds and are 
therefore becoming somewhat more aggressive in marketing loans, 
especially in the retail lines.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Agriculture
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Despite some improvement, the farm sector remains troubled. 
Production costs are moderating and land prices have stabilized. 
Winter wheat conditions are good in the Kansas City District, where 
a mild winter and higher prices are also helping livestock 
producers. Bad weather has caused heavy crop losses and delays in 
planting in the western part of the country and is expected to lead 
to price increases later in the spring. Heavy participation is 
generally expected in the PIK program, which will result in reduced 
acreage in some crops and areas.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            The Outlook
           </strong>
           <br/>
           The outlook is generally positive. The failure of activity to match 
January levels is considered transitory. Many industries still 
languishing are expected to feel the upswing before long. There is 
little optimism regarding the capital goods industries, however. 
Further, there is little expectation of significant gains in the 
employment over the near term. There is some scattered concern over 
the potential for higher inflation rates. Recent rises in non-petroleum industrial prices are seen as ominous in some quarters.
