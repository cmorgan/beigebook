            Overview
           </strong>
           <br/>
           The pace of economic expansion appear" to have slowed recently. 
Retail sales are strong and retailers are optimistic. Manufacturing 
activity continues to use but at a reduced pace from earlier this 
year. Retail and manufacturer's inventories appear to be close to 
desired levels. No strong upward price pressures are reported. Sales 
and starts of new houses are slowing. Rising interest rates and 
adverse weather are reported to be hurting the firm sector. Loan 
demand continues to grow in most districts.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Retail Sales
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Retail sales for May and early June are reported to be strong and 
better than expected in most districts. Year-over-year gains of 
between 10% and 20% are common. Sales of summer apparel, fans, air 
conditioners, outdoor furniture and grills were stimulated by 
exceptionally hot weather in the east. Minneapolis reports sales, 
depressed by cold weather in May, are firming in June. Inventories 
are generally at satisfactory levels, although a few districts 
report them to be slightly larger than desired. Retailers are 
optimistic about the outlook for sales during the remainder at 1984.
          </p>
          <p>
           Automobile sales continue to be strong, although St. Louis notes 
that sales are sluggish at sane dealers. San Francisco reports auto 
sales at their highest level since the late 1970s, are being 
supported by subsidized financing by dealers, and some auto dealers 
in the Cleveland district say that consumer lending rates haven't 
risen enough to damp sales. St. Louis observes that small cars are 
selling better than large cars, and Minneapolis reports recreational 
vehicles sealing exceptionally well.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Manufacturing
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Manufacturing activity continues to expand, but at a slower pace 
than earlier this year. Manufacturing employment is rising slowly in 
most districts. Production of aluminum, paper, tires, heavy-duty 
trucks and trailers, and medium- and full-sized cars is reported by 
various districts to be at full capacity. Demand for electronic 
equipment continues its strong growth. San Francisco reports lumber 
producers are cutting payrolls because of the national homebuilding 
slowdown, and Atlanta adds that softening housing demand has also 
cut the furniture industry's demand for lumber. Various districts 
report foreign competition is crimping production of copper, steel,
furniture, and machine tools. Dallas, however, notes strong 
production growth and lengthening lead tines for primary metals. 
Modernization and cost cutting are still emphasized in capital 
investment but there are a few reports of capacity expansion. Boston 
reports demand for capital goods used by the energy, steel, and farm 
equipment industries remains depressed. Inventories are generally 
near desired levels and are growing slowly. There are only a few 
reports of shortages and lengthening lead times. Price increases are 
being restrained by vigorous domestic and foreign competition. 
Cleveland reports that major steel producers expect little or no 
profit this year because of weak prices.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Construction and Real Estate
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Sales and starts of new houses slowed in May and early June in most 
districts in response to rising mortgage interest rates. Chicago 
reports lenders have tightened credit standards. San Francisco notes 
the slowing has been moderated by "increased public acceptance of 
adjustable rate mortgages and the increased offerings on 'buy-down' 
programs by builders." Dallas observes caution in multifamily 
construction because of fears of overbuilding, but St. Louis reports 
some building of apartments.
          </p>
          <p>
           In contrast, New York reports house sales and starts are so strong 
that some builders have "suspended" sales because they are producing 
at capacity, and Richmond says the trend in housing construction is 
quite strong.
          </p>
          <p>
           Nonresidential construction is reported to be strong by San 
Francisco and New York, "active" by Minneapolis, and down by 
Atlanta. Dallas reports a decline nonresidential construction.
          </p>
          <p>
           Atlanta reports lumber prices are falling while Kansas City reports 
price increases for sheetrock and cement. According to Chicago, a 
shortage of gypsum board has ended because builders and distributors 
have stopped adding to inventory. Dallas comments that the high 
level of construction has some lumber, concrete, and brick plants 
running multiple shifts.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Agriculture
           </strong>
           <br/>
           The agricultural sector is reported to be hurt by rising interest 
rates and bad weather. Reports of adverse weather are widespread. 
Droughts, blizzards, and excessive rain are reported to be hampering 
agricultural production. Minneapolis comments that many counties in 
that district have been declared disaster areas because of weather. 
San Francisco notes that abundant vegetable harvests have pushed 
prices to or below the break-even point for many producers. Rising 
interest rates and weak income prospects are reported to be placing 
extreme financial pressure on some farmers. Minneapolis reports that 
it is increasingly difficult for banks to find acceptable 
agricultural loans. In the St. Louis district, this year's crops are 
reported to be "critical" to the financial survival of many farmers. 
Kansas City says bankers in that district are concerned by the 
"increasing number of farm bankruptcies."
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Energy
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Cleveland reports coal production is rising as users increase 
inventories as a strike hedge. Richmond reports coal output has 
risen significantly in 1984 but is facing strong foreign 
competition. San Francisco reports the coal industry is laying off 
workers because of foreign competition. Dallas reports oil drilling 
activity is substantially above the year-earlier level, and drill 
pipe inventories have fallen to desired levels. Atlanta reports 
better prospects for its energy sector because of "sharply lower 
drilling costs" and rising demand for oil.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Commercial Banking
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Several districts report commercial end industrial loan demand is 
growing strongly. Philadelphia says commercial and industrial 
lending has been "especially strong" in the last six weeks. An 
exception is Cleveland where business lending has not expanded in 
the last month. Consumer installment lending is "brisk" in 
Philadelphia and "robust" in Cleveland, but down in St. Louis. A few 
districts report rapid deposit growth and Atlanta says banks are 
very liquid. San Francisco notes a large runoff of funds from money 
market deposit accounts. Two districts comment on the safety of 
deposits: St. Louis reports that "a few corporate treasurers have 
expressed concern about banking problems, and have lowered some 
balances to decrease exposure at any one institution," and San 
Francisco notes that some depositors at a few smaller institutions 
have shifted some deposits into U.S. Treasury securities.
