           Economic expansion continues at a pace varying from sluggish in two 
Districts to moderate or strong elsewhere. Employment levels are 
stable or rising, with tight labor market conditions noted in some 
areas. While retail sales are generally lackluster, auto sales have 
picked up. Manufacturers report moderate to healthy gains in sales 
and orders, although four Districts note signs of a possible 
slowing. Capacity constraints and shortages have developed in some 
Districts and materials price increases are widespread. Construction 
activity is mixed, with home construction reported to be weaker than 
nonresidential building. While the impact of this summer's drought 
varies, even within states, the corn and wheat crops have suffered 
extensive damage. The recent rains may save much of the soybean 
crop, however.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Consumer Spending
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Most Reserve Banks find retail sales to be sluggish, with only 
Atlanta and Minneapolis reporting any real vigor. Respondents cited 
apparel and furniture sales as particularly weak; moreover, the 
rising cost of imported clothing has reduced margins as well as 
sales volumes. Inventories, however, are said to be in balance: only 
in the Cleveland and St. Louis Districts were buildups reported. 
Boston and San Francisco retailers attribute this healthy inventory 
situation to careful monitoring: retailers in New York, 
Philadelphia, Cleveland, and St. Louis, are reportedly resorting to 
heavy promotions to clear the shelves.
          </p>
          <p>
           Retailers expressed mild optimism about the next six months, with 
those in the Atlanta, Minneapolis, Richmond and Dallas Districts 
expressing greater confidence in the future than merchants in 
Philadelphia, Cleveland, Kansas City, and St. Louis.
          </p>
          <p>
           In marked contrast to general retail conditions, many Districts 
characterize auto sales as strong and above dealer expectations. 
Only Richmond finds car sales declining. Domestic makes, aided by 
manufacturer incentives, are said to be moving briskly. Foreign 
autos, by contrast, are reportedly rising in price and languishing 
in the showrooms. San Francisco finds inventories of unsold imports 
now standing at "unsustainably high levels."
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Manufacturing
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Manufacturing sales and orders continue to grow at a moderate to 
healthy pace in most Districts. Respondents credit manufacturers' 
investment and export activity for much of this growth. While 
contacts in Philadelphia and Dallas see some pick-up in demand from 
earlier months, Boston, New York, Richmond and San Francisco report 
recent signs of slowing. Strong sectors include steel and other 
primary metals, machinery—particularly machine tools—fabricated metals, commercial aircraft and railcars. Atlanta and 
Chicago also see strength in autos, tires and some other consumer 
goods. Among the weaker sectors were agricultural equipment and most 
defense goods, as well as energy-related and construction-related 
products.
          </p>
          <p>
           Increases in the prices of such materials as metals, paper and food 
were widely noted. While a few contacts expect these prices to 
stabilize, more think they will continue to rise. Kansas City, 
Cleveland, Richmond and San Francisco report that shortages of 
steel, valves, castings, motors and chemicals have developed. 
Cleveland, Dallas and San Francisco also mention capacity 
constraints, especially in petro-chemicals and pulp and paper. In 
this environment, manufacturers are reportedly choosing to hold 
higher inventories and are finding it easier to raise their own 
finished goods prices.
          </p>
          <p>
           Manufacturing employment is generally stable or increasing slightly. 
Cleveland and Philadelphia report healthy gains while Atlanta and 
Boston report recent layoffs. Most contacts foresee little or no 
acceleration in wage pressures. San Francisco respondents were 
evenly divided on this issue, however, and Dallas and Minneapolis 
noted some industry-specific pressures.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Cleveland
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Residential construction is down from year-ago levels, although the 
Richmond District reports strong housing construction and sales. In 
the San Francisco District residential building is very healthy 
along the coast but weak in some of the inland states. Richmond, 
Atlanta, Minneapolis and Kansas City also observe substantial 
variations in the strength of housing sales and construction within 
their districts, with larger cities experiencing stronger activity 
than more rural areas.
          </p>
          <p>
           Reports on nonresidential construction and real estate activity were 
positive for the most part. Although nonresidential construction 
contracts were down from a year ago in the St. Louis District, 
office building construction has surged in some cities in the 
Atlanta District and leasing has picked up in New York. Office 
building construction has slowed somewhat in Chicago, but remains at 
a high level; industrial real estate and construction activity in 
the District has strengthened. Dallas reports that both 
nonresidential and residential construction contracts have 
stabilized, a development suggesting that a prolonged downturn in 
construction may be at an end.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Agriculture and Natural Resources
           </strong>
           <br/>
           The impact of this simmer's drought varies considerably by crop-even 
within a given state. In the Kansas City District, winter wheat 
matured on time and the harvest was normal, but in the Chicago and 
Minneapolis Districts recent rains were too late for the spring 
wheat, barley, oats and hay. The July rains were also too late for 
much of the corn crop. In some parts of the Kansas City, St. Louis 
and Minneapolis Districts, corn yields are expected to be down 50 
percent or more. However, if the recent improvement in the weather 
holds, Chicago, St. Louis, Atlanta and Minneapolis suggest that the 
soybean crop could recover to near normal levels. Cotton, rice, 
sugar cane, peaches and citrus fruits are also in good shape, but 
the state of vegetable crops varies. In the Chicago District (an 
important source of processing supplies), vegetables were severely 
damaged, but in Atlanta the crop is satisfactory. While ranchers 
have sold more animals than usual and cattle prices have fallen, no 
large-scale liquidation has occurred. Instead, according to reports 
from Dallas, Atlanta and Kansas City, record numbers of cattle have 
been put on supplemental feed; as a result, ranchers' profits will 
be squeezed. Nevertheless, the Kansas City and Minneapolis Districts 
point out that improvements in the financial positions of farm 
borrowers and lenders over the last two years will help most 
withstand the impact of the drought.
          </p>
          <p>
           Atlanta reports that demand for forest products has weakened 
recently with the slowdown in building activity, while San Francisco 
sees no such decline. Both are experiencing strong export activity.
          </p>
          <p>
           With the price of oil below $15 per barrel in mid-July, Atlanta 
finds oil production slipping and Dallas and Kansas City report or 
expect a fall in the rig count. Atlanta and Richmond see coal output 
rising with help from the weak dollar and strength in steel.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Financial Activity
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Except in the Dallas District, loan demand is healthy. Business 
lending is reported to have accelerated in the Philadelphia and 
Atlanta Districts, while consumer lending has grown vigorously in 
Cleveland, Kansas City and San Francisco. In the Cleveland District 
consumer installment loans have recently increased at an annual rate 
greater than 50 percent. Consumer lending is said to be rather weak 
in the Philadelphia and New York Districts, but demand for home 
equity loans remains very strong. New York respondents also note 
that delinquency rates on consumer loans are equal to or lower than 
year-ago levels. Reports on commercial real estate lending are 
mixed, with Cleveland reporting relatively strong growth and Atlanta 
and Philadelphia seeing some tapering off.
          </p>
          <p>
           Richmond bank executives report substantial increases in deposits in 
July; Philadelphia bankers have also seen a pickup. In the Dallas 
District, however, deposits and assets—particularly business loans—both continue to decline.
