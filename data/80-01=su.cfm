          <p>
           This month's REDBOOK reports show total activity continuing to hold 
at high levels, but softening is expected in the next several 
months. Mild weather in the North, in contrast to recent years, has 
influenced activity both for better and worse. Weakness is still 
centered in the auto and housing industries and their satellites, 
while performance has been "spotty" or "mixed" in other sectors. 
Several districts reported retail sales, other than motor vehicles, 
to be surprisingly strong both before and after Christmas. Signs of 
erosion in the generally vigorous capital goods industries are 
spreading. Unlike housing, nonresidential construction activity has 
remained at advanced levels. Inventories are under close rein and 
are in good balance overall. Price inflation has not abated. The 
President's grain embargo has not depressed prices as had been 
feared. Defense orders have not increased significantly to date, and 
manufacturers' ability to boost output is closely limited in the 
short run. Credit demands have moderated in the face of high 
interest rates and tighter credit standards.
          </p>
          <p>
           Generalizations offered by the twelve districts reflect trends in 
the major concentrations of activity in each region. Boston 
respondents "still see very few signs of a downturn." New York 
reports activity "surprisingly resilient in January." Philadelphia 
finds a contrast between a decline in manufacturing and 
"unexpectedly strong" retail sales. Cleveland respondents "still 
expect a recession," but are less certain about "timing and depth." 
The Richmond district's businessmen remain "decidedly negative." 
Atlanta reports weakness in retail sales, but a boom in tourism. 
Chicago, affected more than the nation by the slowdown, sees 
"further deterioration." In St. Louis, the evidence suggests that 
total business activity has "declined somewhat" in recent weeks. 
Minneapolis reports that "the region is not in a recession," but 
"signs of softening persist." Kansas City says "business activity 
continues to slow." Dallas finds near-term weakness confined largely 
to autos and housing, with sustained long-term growth apparently 
assured. San Francisco reports "no major decline in employment or 
production."
          </p>
          <p>
           Mild temperatures and light snowfalls in December and January 
contrasted with experience of recent years. In the northern 
districts there were few impediments to transportation of 
commodities and people, and construction continued at abnormally 
high levels. As a result, retail sales and manufacturing may have 
been maintained at deceivingly high rates. However, lack of snow 
markedly reduced tourist outlays in resort areas. Winter merchandise 
had to be moved with large markdowns. Stocks of fuel for heating 
were more than ample. Tourism in the South, by contrast, set new 
records.
          </p>
          <p>
           Auto and truck sales remain seriously depressed, with most parts end 
assembly plants operating far below capacity. Some plants are being 
closed permanently. Sales of imports and desirable small domestic 
cars are still limited by availability. Many auto dealerships have 
closed and there are fears that many more will go under before sales 
revive in the spring. High interest rates are a major burden for 
dealers carrying inventories and many potential car buyers have been 
deterred by high finance charges and tighter lending standards.
          </p>
          <p>
           Residential construction activity and sales of existing properties 
have declined further, with the end of the slide still not in sight. 
The recent suspension of state mortgage usury ceilings has not 
significantly benefited states where usury was a barrier. High 
interest rates, large down payments, and high prices keep many 
potential buyers out of the market. Most districts report 
considerable strength in nonresidential construction, especially 
office and commercial buildings. Atlanta expects a surge in building 
of ethanol plants. In the mining sector coal gasification projects 
are underway, and precious metals are booming in the West under the 
stimulus of high prices.
          </p>
          <p>
           Capital equipment production continues at high levels, but this 
sector probably is no longer expanding overall. Among the strongest 
groups are machine tools, railroad equipment, energy-conserving 
equipment, items related to oil and gas exploration, electronics, 
and commercial aircraft. Among the weaker groups are construction 
equipment, farm equipment, heavy trucks and trailers. Some districts 
expect a rise in defense orders, but expansion of output will be 
limited by the availability of critical materials, various 
components, and skilled workers.
          </p>
          <p>
           Inventories at both the manufacturing and distribution levels have 
been kept lean by adjustments in output, except for some products 
facing very weak demand. Retail inventories had appeared somewhat 
high before Christmas, but special promotions helped to correct 
these conditions.
          </p>
          <p>
           Reports from virtually all districts show inflation continuing at a 
high rate, with no abatement expected in 1980. Rising energy prices 
and rising labor costs are largely responsible.
          </p>
          <p>
           The farm sector is relatively prosperous because of bumper crops and 
high prices. However, the grain embargo has created a larger-than 
expected stock overhanging the market. Also, farm credit conditions 
are very tight, causing some farmers to defer purchases of equipment 
and other investments.
          </p>
          <p>
           The new two and one-half year floating rate certificates are proving 
popular at both S&amp;Ls and banks. Six-month money market certificates 
continue to expand at a rapid pace, and account for a larger volume 
of funds. Reports on the strength of business loan demand were 
mixed.
