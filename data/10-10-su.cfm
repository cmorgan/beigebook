           Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas based on   information collected on or before October 8, 2010. This document summarizes   comments received from business and other contacts outside the Federal Reserve   and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials.

         <hr align="left" width="600"/>
         <p>
          Reports from the twelve Federal Reserve Districts suggest that, on balance,   national economic activity continued to rise, albeit at a modest pace, during   the reporting period from September to early October.
         </p>
         <p>
          Manufacturing activity continued to expand, with production and new orders   rising across most Districts. Demand for nonfinancial services was reported to   be stable to modestly increasing overall. Consumer spending was steady to up   slightly, but consumers remained price-sensitive, and purchases were mostly   limited to necessities and nondiscretionary items. New vehicle sales held steady   or rose during the reporting period; sales of used automobiles were strong as   well. Activity in the travel and tourism sector picked up.
         </p>
         <p>
          Housing markets remained weak with most Districts reporting sales below   year-ago levels. Reports on prices suggested stability, however. Conditions in   the commercial real estate sector were subdued, and construction was expected to   remain weak. Lending activity was stable in most Districts. Agricultural   conditions were generally favorable, and above-average yields were expected in   most reporting Districts. Activity in the energy sector continued to expand.
         </p>
         <p>
          Input costs, most notably for agricultural commodities and industrial metals,   rose further. Shipping rates increased, and retailers in some Districts noted   rising wholesale prices. However, prices of final goods and services were mostly   stable as higher input costs were not passed on to consumers. Wage pressures   were minimal.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Manufacturing
          </strong>
          <br/>
          Manufacturing activity continued to expand,   and several Districts reported gains in production or new orders across a wide   range of industries. The only exceptions were the Philadelphia and Richmond   Districts, where activity softened compared with the previous reporting period.   Exports boosted manufacturing activity according to contacts in the Cleveland,   Chicago, and Kansas City Districts. Producers of semiconductors and other   high-tech equipment saw continued growth in sales in the Boston, Dallas, and San   Francisco Districts. Auto production rose strongly in the Cleveland and Chicago   Districts. Metals producers in the Chicago District reported that September   sales were the strongest year-to-date, while contacts in the Minneapolis,   Dallas, and San Francisco Districts saw only modest gains. Shipments of steel in   the Cleveland District continued to be buoyed by demand from energy-related,   automotive, and heavy equipment industries. Food processors in the Philadelphia   and Dallas Districts noted solid demand for their products, while a few contacts   in the St. Louis and Minneapolis Districts reported plans to expand existing   operations.
         </p>
         <p>
          Refiners in the Dallas and San Francisco Districts noted a slowdown in   activity and rising inventories. Demand for construction-related products   remained weak, and reports on activity in the wood products and furniture   manufacturing industries were mixed.
         </p>
         <p>
          Hiring at manufacturing firms remained sluggish. Inventories were generally   light or in line with orders. Future capital spending plans appeared to be   limited, except for in the St. Louis District where several manufacturers   reported plans to build new plants or expand operations. Manufacturers'   assessments of future factory activity were optimistic in the New York,   Philadelphia, Chicago, and Kansas City Districts, where contacts expect business   conditions to remain positive or to improve in coming months.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Nonfinancial Services
          </strong>
          <br/>
          Activity was stable to modestly   increasing for most professional and nonfinancial services. Demand for   information technology (IT) services remained solid. IT firms in the San   Francisco District noted recent growth was spurred by business investment to   enhance production efficiency. In the Minneapolis District firms noted solid   demand for IT services from corporate clients.
         </p>
         <p>
          Accounting activity improved slightly, spurred by merger and acquisition   work. Contacts in the Boston and Dallas Districts noted increases in consulting   activity since the last report. Healthcare consulting picked up as businesses   responded to regulatory changes following healthcare reform. Appraisal and title   companies noted continued strength during the reporting period, and there were   some reports from architectural firms that activity had picked up.
         </p>
         <p>
          Demand for transportation services appears to have slowed, although reports   were mixed. Freight companies in the Cleveland District noted steady to   declining volumes over the past six weeks, and Kansas City's report said   transportation firms saw unexpected weakness. Rail companies in the Atlanta   District reported positive, but slower growth of automobile and industrial goods   shipments, while port activity in the Richmond District was mixed. Dallas'   report said intermodal and railroad cargo volumes edged up, but growth in   international container trade volumes flattened, and small parcel shipping   volumes declined in September. San Francisco reported a pickup in demand for   trucking services.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Consumer Spending and Tourism
          </strong>
          <br/>
          Retail spending was flat to   moderately positive in most Districts, with the exception of the Richmond and   Atlanta Districts, which noted declining traffic and sales. Contacts in the   Kansas City District noted sales were stronger than expected; back-to-school   spending boosted sales in the Philadelphia and Dallas Districts. Retail spending   grew modestly in the Minneapolis and San Francisco Districts, and was flat in   the Cleveland, Chicago, and St. Louis Districts. Retailers said consumers are   slowly regaining confidence, but remain price-conscious and were largely   limiting purchases to necessities and nondiscretionary items. There were   reports, however, of a pickup in sales of moderately priced household goods in   the Philadelphia, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts, and gains in apparel   sales were reported in the Atlanta and Chicago Districts. Inventories were at   desired levels. Looking ahead, retailers in several Districts expected modest   sales growth through year-end. In particular, some contacts in New York planned   to add more holiday staff than last year.
         </p>
         <p>
          Most Districts reported that sales of new vehicles held steady or rose during   the reporting period. Sales of used vehicles were strong as well. Inventories   remained tight, particularly for popular vehicles. Used car prices rose,   reflective of solid demand and lean inventories. Respondents' outlooks were for   slight growth in sales through year-end.
         </p>
         <p>
          Reports from most Districts pointed to continued improvement in travel and   tourist activity. The Richmond District reported that tourist activity   strengthened, and contacts in San Francisco noted that growth in business travel   and convention activity led to rising visitor counts and hotel occupancy rates.   Hotel occupancy for popular tourist destinations in the Minneapolis and Kansas   City Districts also rose during the reporting period and was above year-ago   levels. New York's report noted that hotel occupancy rates remained high in   Manhattan, but October bookings were somewhat weaker than expected. Atlanta   noted that tourist activity in some areas was still being affected by the Gulf   oil spill, but losses incurred in these areas were offset by increased activity   in Northeast Florida, Georgia, and Tennessee and respondents' outlooks for the   remainder of the year were positive. Airline traffic was stable to slightly down   according to the Dallas District, but conditions were much better than a year   earlier thanks to strength in business travel. Restaurants and food service   contacts in the Kansas City and San Francisco Districts also noted slight   increases in activity.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Real Estate and Construction
          </strong>
          <br/>
          Housing markets remained   weak. Most District Beige Book reports suggested overall home sales were   sluggish or declining and were below year-ago levels. There were scattered   reports of some improvement in sales in a few Districts, however. Philadelphia   noted an increase in sales of existing homes, and Richmond, Kansas City, and   Dallas reported upticks in sales of higher-priced homes. Sales reports were   mixed in the St. Louis and Minneapolis Districts, with increases in some metro   areas and declines in others. Home inventories were elevated or rising according   to most District reports. Home prices were generally stable since the last   report, although Kansas City noted a decrease in prices, and New York and   Minneapolis reported declines in some metros. Homebuilders in the Atlanta   District reported downward price pressure and expressed concern about rising   foreclosures and bank-owned properties coming to market.
         </p>
         <p>
          Single-family construction activity was at very low levels, but had improved   somewhat in the Chicago, St. Louis, and Kansas City Districts. Atlanta reported   a softening of construction activity overall, and Minneapolis said single-family   building activity was mixed across metros. Builders in the Dallas District said   they had pulled back on starts considerably after the run-up earlier in the   year.
         </p>
         <p>
          Respondents' outlooks suggested sales and construction would remain subdued   through year-end. There were some reports that tighter credit standards for   buyers and small builders, along with general economic uncertainty, were   stalling activity.
         </p>
         <p>
          Conditions in the commercial real estate sector remained subdued. Reports   suggested rental rates continued to decline for most commercial property types.   The one exception was the apartment sector, where higher leasing activity led to   fewer concessions, most notably in Manhattan. Office, industrial and retail   rental markets remained weak, although there were a few reports of slight   increases in leasing activity in the Richmond, Chicago and Dallas Districts.   Commercial property sales were low overall, but contacts in the Chicago and   Dallas Districts said investment demand for distressed commercial properties   remained strong. Given lackluster demand for commercial space, nonresidential   construction activity was limited to mostly public projects, according to   District reports. Industry contacts appeared to believe that the commercial real   estate and construction sectors would remain weak for some time.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Banking and Finance
          </strong>
          <br/>
          Lending activity was stable at low   levels across most Districts, but there were some reports that demand picked up   slightly. The Richmond and Dallas District reports noted increased lending   activity, and Chicago said credit conditions continued to improve in the   District. Reports from Richmond and Dallas suggested that competition for   quality loans had picked up. Some contacts noted there was pressure to price   loans slightly more aggressively.
         </p>
         <p>
          Demand for commercial and industrial loans remained weak as businesses   continued to postpone capital spending plans because of economic and public   policy uncertainties. However, merger and acquisition lending picked up in a few   Districts. Commercial real estate lending remained subdued and loan standards   were still tight.
         </p>
         <p>
          On the consumer side, lending was sluggish, but there were scattered reports   of improvement. Contacts in the Cleveland and Dallas Districts reported growth   in auto loans. Residential mortgage lending and refinancing activity increased   in several Districts, and San Francisco reported an increase in demand for   nonconforming mortgage loans.
         </p>
         <p>
          Credit quality changed little on balance. New York reported a decrease in   delinquency rates on consumer loans, however, and overall quality improved in   the Philadelphia and Richmond Districts, according to reports.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Agriculture and Natural Resources
          </strong>
          <br/>
          Agricultural conditions   were mostly favorable. Fall harvest was generally ahead of its normal pace, and   above-average yields were expected in most reporting Districts. There were a few   exceptions, however. Widespread rains flooded farmland and delayed harvests in   the Minneapolis District while dry weather affected some crops in the Atlanta   and St. Louis Districts. Unfavorable weather conditions and resulting crop   losses abroad continued to boost export demand for U.S. agricultural products.   Commodity prices strengthened further, boosting optimism among producers in the   Dallas District and spurring higher cropland values and capital spending on   agricultural equipment in the Kansas City District. Additionally, corn producers   in the Chicago District were holding on to recently harvested corn in hope of   even higher prices.
         </p>
         <p>
          The energy sector continued to expand, with activity rising further in the   Atlanta, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts. The   Minneapolis District reported that mines were operating near capacity, and coal   production was robust in the Cleveland and Kansas City Districts. Firms in the   Dallas District noted strong domestic land-based drilling and a pickup in   overseas demand had offset losses resulting from the moratorium in the Gulf of   Mexico. The Cleveland and Kansas City Districts reported that strong activity   had prompted hiring and an increase in capital spending at some energy firms.   Respondents' outlooks were mostly positive, although low natural gas prices had   dampened the outlook for producers in the Cleveland and Dallas Districts.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Prices and Wages
          </strong>
          <br/>
          Input costs rose slightly, but prices of   final goods and services were stable across Districts. Upward pressures on   agricultural commodities and industrial metals prices were reported by several   Districts. In addition, shipping costs increased in the Philadelphia, Atlanta,   and Dallas Districts, and retailers in the Philadelphia and Chicago Districts   reported higher wholesale prices. Pass-through of rising input costs to final   prices remained limited although there were scattered reports of increases.   Prices of petrochemicals rose in the Dallas District, and a few manufacturers in   the Boston District said recent price increases on some of their products had   been successful. Some manufacturers in the Atlanta District noted rising costs   of materials and employee benefits would likely be passed on to customers in the   near-term, and several manufacturers in the Cleveland District announced plans   to raise product prices in an attempt to recover rising costs. In response to   rising food costs, food producers in the Dallas District reported plans to raise   prices, and menu prices at restaurants rose modestly in the Kansas City   District.
         </p>
         <p>
          Wage pressures remained minimal. Most District reports found little evidence   of wage increases in general. There were widespread reports across Districts   that firms anticipated increased costs of employee benefits as a result of   healthcare reform.
         </p>
         <p>
          Hiring remained limited, with many firms reluctant to add to permanent   payrolls given economic softness. Reports from staffing firms were mixed.   Staffing firms in the New York and Dallas Districts noted a slowdown in demand   for their services, and contacts in the Cleveland District said new job openings   declined. Richmond's report noted demand for temporary workers picked up   slightly since the last report, and staffing contacts in the Philadelphia   District said clients were adding positions as workloads increased. The Atlanta   report noted a preference for increasing staff hours and using temporary help   rather than hiring additional full-time staff.
