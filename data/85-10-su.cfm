           This month's commentaries by the twelve Federal Reserve Banks 
suggest that the economy has advanced slightly since the end of 
summer and is poised for further growth. Representatives from the 
retail trade sector say auto sales have been strong and sales of 
general merchandise, though lower than expected, are still well 
ahead of last year. Retailers expect a good fourth quarter and 
continued strength as the economy resumes growth. Bankers say loan 
volume continues to expand, with strong gains in consumer and real 
estate loans leading the way. Residential construction, especially 
of single family houses, is also up in early fall. Sales of homes 
are brisk and are expected to remain so. Nonresidential construction 
also remains healthy, and, although some signs suggest a slowdown 
say be starting, projects already underway should provide momentum 
to keep the industry going at least through the first quarter of 
1986. In the manufacturing sector, industrial activity remains 
unchanged, but manufacturers are more optimistic about the outlook 
for 1986.
          </p>
          <p>
           The sector with the most significant problems and the bleakest 
outlook remains agriculture. Farmers continue to face financial 
distress in many areas of the country. Crop farmers in particular 
may find themselves sinking deeper as near-record crop yields 
depress already low farm prices further.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Manufacturing and Mining
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Business conditions in the industrial sector appear to be holding 
steady in October with most districts reporting mixed or unchanged 
manufacturing activity. Specific indicators, such as new orders and 
shipments, vary among geographic areas and among industries, but 
reveal no clear trend. Employment also varies across districts and 
businesses, but little change is noted. Producers' inventories 
appear to be at acceptable levels, except in electronics, where some 
involuntary accumulation has resulted from the slump in that 
industry. Prices are generally steady; some districts report some
downward movement.
          </p>
          <p>
           Among the stronger industries are autos, auto related products, 
defense products, and aerospace products. Housing related items, 
chemicals, and building materials are mixed. The paper industry, one 
of the strongest in this expansion through 1984, is starting to show 
signs of weakening according to reports from Atlanta, Minneapolis, 
and San Francisco. Steel, electronics, and farm equipment are 
reported to be the biggest drags on the industrial sector at this 
time. The energy industry is also lagging far behind, with Dallas 
reporting the lowest oil rig count in Texas since 1976.
          </p>
          <p>
           Looking ahead, some districts report a slightly better outlook for 
manufacturers for 1986, which is reflected in increased capital 
spending plans for the coning year. In many cases, however, planned 
increases will only replace spending originally scheduled for 1985 
and then cancelled. Moreover, according to indications from Boston 
and Richmond, most of the expenditure on plant and equipment will be 
for cost containment, productivity enhancement, and the introduction 
of new products, rather than for capacity expansion.
          </p>
          <p>
           Cleveland reports that coal mining remains very depressed in many 
areas with unemployment in many mining counties running in double-digits. Richmond also notes that coal production is down from last 
year, although many mines are producing at high levels.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Consumer Spending
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Cut-rate financing arrangements provided by auto manufacturers gave 
auto sales a strong boost in September and helped overall retail 
sales to turn in a good third quarter performance in most parts of 
the nation. Sales of general merchandise, while still posting gains 
on balance, have slowed from their pre-Labor Day pace and are behind 
retailers' projections in some areas. Some merchants say general 
sales might have been stronger and on target, but were weakened by 
bad weather conditions in many areas and a surge in spending on 
autos. Reports of retail inventories range from slightly tight to a 
little heavy; overall stock levels appear to be about where 
retailers want them, and no significant change is planned aside from 
the fourth quarter seasonal buildup.
          </p>
          <p>
           Merchants' near-term outlook is generally optimistic, with renewed 
economic growth expected to result in continued strength in sales. 
Many store managers expect the fourth quarter to be good, with year-over-year gains in the 5 to 10 percent range, despite a shorter 
shopping season and growing concern over the consumer debt burden.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Finance
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Total loan demand remains strong in most areas, with loan volume 
outstanding at major U.S. banks running 8-to-9 percent ahead of a 
year ago and nearly 1 percent higher than in August. San Francisco 
notes that small banks are experiencing greater loan demand than are 
large banks, as many customers of larger institutions have turned to 
the commercial paper market and have reduced bank borrowing.
          </p>
          <p>
           Loan categories posting the biggest gains include real estate and 
consumer loans. Consumer loans might have been even stronger were it 
not for special financing deals offered by auto manufacturers. A 
major portion of the demand for real estate loans results from 
refinancing of existing mortgages. The weakest performance is 
observed in agricultural loans. Farm loans are falling in many 
districts, as banks both cut back borrowing and increase write-offs.
          </p>
          <p>
           Deposit growth is strong in most areas. Bankers in Philadelphia say 
they have been able to meet time deposit targets without aggressive 
pricing. Kansas City reports that many thrifts have yet to lower 
minimum balance requirements on MMDAs and SuperNOWs.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Real Estate and Construction
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Residential construction is reported to be stronger in September, 
except in Kansas City and St. Louis, where homebuilding is 
continuing at the same rate as in late summer. The most significant 
gains are being posted in single family housing construction, while 
multi-family construction is holding steady in some areas and 
weakening in others. No shortages of either labor or materials are 
reported, except in parts of New York where Hurricane Gloria caused 
substantial damage. Residential sales are strong in most areas, 
spurred by stable mortgage rates at just over 12 percent, rising 
incomes, and the availability of subsidized mortgage money in some 
states. House prices are reported to be firm and new listings 
strong.
          </p>
          <p>
           Nonresidential construction is generally weaker than residential 
building, but still healthy in many regions. There is some evidence 
that new construction may be slowing slightly, but projects already 
underway should provide continued strength. Many observers are 
surprised that nonresidential construction has not already lost 
steam, in view of rising vacancy rates and a general feeling that 
the office market is already overbuilt. Chicago notes that some 
projects have been started recently so that they will be 
grandfathered under the current tax code and thereby protected from 
future tax changes.
          </p>
          <p>
           Office leasing activity is mixed, with vacancy rates at suburban 
locations generally higher than in downtown areas. As a result, 
rents in suburban areas may hold steady or even fall in coming 
months.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Agriculture
           </strong>
           <br/>
           While livestock farmers have gotten some measure of relief recently 
from higher livestock prices, crop farmers remain in financial 
stress in many areas, and may find their plight worsening. Harvests 
currently underway are likely to yield bumper crops that will drive 
farm prices and revenues even lower. Many farmers are storing their 
harvest under Commodity Credit Corporation loans. Others, however, 
are selling at current prices in order to get cash to pay off loans 
and stave off foreclosure.
          </p>
          <p>
           Farm land values dropped further in the third quarter. Kansas City 
reports that a great deal of farm land is for sale, but that very 
little is actually changing hands. Credit has become tighter and 
many suppliers have become less willing to deal in terms other than 
cash.
