          <p>
           The nation's economy grew at a moderate, sustainable pace in 
February, March, and early April. Business activity was relatively 
strong in the Midwest and South. Consumer spending in most of the 
country was moderately strong, but signs of slowing were apparent in 
the Northeast and West. Manufacturing activity expanded at a fairly 
strong pace throughout the country, and manufacturers are generally 
optimistic about sales prospects for the rest of the year. The 
backlog of new orders has been mixed, but no significant changes 
were found. No serious bottlenecks were reported. Despite the 
continued strength in manufacturing output, none of the districts 
report significant increases in input prices or labor costs. 
Residential construction was mixed, but nonresidential construction 
levels were described as moderately strong. Much of the winter wheat 
crop was lost due to dry weather early this spring. Recent rains, 
however, have improved the outlook for the spring wheat crop, as 
well as for agriculture in general. Favorable conditions were 
apparent in the mining and lumber industries.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Consumer Spending
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Consumer spending slowed significantly in several districts but grew 
fairly strongly in others. Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Richmond, 
and San Francisco report sluggish retail sales. The sales slowdown 
was particularly marked in consumer durables. Lower-than-expected 
automobile sales were reported by Richmond, Minneapolis, Kansas 
City, and San Francisco. A large dealer in the Minneapolis-St. Paul 
area describes the slowdown in car sales as the worst in over twenty 
years. Boston reports that retailers are curtailing 
their capital spending programs due to disappointing sales growth, 
focusing spending instead on upgrading distribution systems rather 
than on new construction. Several districts point out that the early 
Easter this year made sales comparisons with last year difficult.
          </p>
          <p>
           Consumer spending on general merchandise is described as fairly 
strong by Cleveland, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City, 
and Dallas. These reports suggest that the economic expansion has 
been stronger lately in the South and Midwest than elsewhere in the 
country. Several of these districts also report an early-April 
recovery in auto sales, partly attributable to enhanced incentives 
for buyers.
          </p>
          <p>
           Inventories were at acceptable levels in all districts. The rate of 
retail price increases is largely reported as being fairly moderate. 
Boston and Minneapolis point to an increase in wholesale prices of 
goods purchases by retailers. Retail prices, however, have not risen 
much, and Boston reports concern about eroding retail margins.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Manufacturing
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Manufacturing activity continued to expand at a fairly strong pace. 
None of the districts report declines in shipments; most report 
significant increases. St. Louis reports that manufacturing 
employment rose by an impressive 10.8 percent from December to 
February. Cleveland reports that cold-rolled and galvanized steel 
operations were at full capacity. Chicago reports that shipments of 
major home appliances reached record levels.
          </p>
          <p>
           Manufacturers are generally optimistic about sales prospects for the 
year. San Francisco reports strong demand for commercial aircraft; 
Atlanta reports significant increases in capacity in the broiler-
chicken producing and processing industry; and Chicago cites brisk 
demand for equipment installed in construction projects. Reports are 
mixed on the backlog of new orders.
          </p>
          <p>
           Boston and Atlanta report some weakness in new orders, but 
Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, and Chicago note that new orders 
increased in many industries.
          </p>
          <p>
           Capacity utilization was generally at satisfactory levels: no 
serious bottlenecks were mentioned. Atlanta reports that capacity 
constraints are easing in several sectors. In contrast, reports on 
capital spending plans are somewhat mixed. Boston reports that half 
the manufacturers they surveyed plan to increase capital spending, 
but a third plan to invest practically nothing. New York reports 
plans for a $70 million business park in the Rochester area. Dallas 
reports that electronics manufacturers are planning significant 
increases in investment spending. Atlanta, however, reports that 
capital investment appeared to be slowing.
          </p>
          <p>
           None of the districts mention significant increases in input prices 
or labor costs. Boston reports that most of their survey respondents 
were not alarmed by steady to slightly higher input prices. 
Philadelphia reports that higher prices were not quite as widespread 
as they were over the winter. Chicago also reports that prices paid 
by manufacturers showed increases, but less so than earlier. 
Respondents to a survey by Kansas City indicate that input prices 
are expected to stabilize or decrease in the near future.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Construction
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Housing construction reports are mixed. New York reports that a glut 
of houses in the metropolitan areas of New York City and New Jersey 
is deterring homebuilding in the area, but homebuilders in upstate 
New York are quite active. Residential construction was vigorous in 
the Chicago area, but first-quarter housing permits in St. Louis 
were down 31.8 percent from a year earlier. Minneapolis and Kansas 
City report declines in residential construction, but Dallas reports 
that single-family housing permits were above last year's levels. 
San Francisco reports that construction activity was strong, though 
limited by a lack of available land.
          </p>
          <p>
           Nonresidential construction is generally described as moderately 
strong. New York reports that office-leasing activity has been 
brisk. Chicago reports that district contracts for nonresidential 
buildings were at their peak last year, and Dallas reports that 
nonresidential building activity showed year-over-year gains in 
contract values.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Employment
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Conditions in the labor market are described as largely 
satisfactory. Unemployment rates are generally low. Boston reports 
that the region's labor markets seemed less tight. New York reports 
that the unemployment rate there dropped sharply, primarily because 
of a decline in the number of job seekers. Atlanta reports that wage 
increases remained mostly in the 3 to 5 percent range, which is not 
regarded as too high. However, Atlanta also notes shortages of 
skilled workers in many sectors. St. Louis reports that payroll 
employment from December through February grew at a relatively high 
6.3 percent annual rate.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Agriculture and Resource-Related Industries
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Soil moisture conditions have improved somewhat in several regions 
after last year's drought. Rains in March and April eased the 
stresses of the drought in California, parts of Missouri, and North 
Dakota. Chicago reports that soil moisture conditions were adequate 
for the start of the growing season in most of the district except 
western Illinois and much of Iowa. However, the recent rains came 
too late for much of the winter wheat crop. Wheat yields are 
expected to be below normal in Kansas and parts of Oklahoma due to 
dry conditions throughout the early spring. According to Dallas, the 
winter wheat crop was damaged by insufficient moisture and by 
insects. Production of fresh vegetables is reported to be recovering 
from the effects of a February freeze in parts of the South and 
Southeast.
          </p>
          <p>
           Oil prices have risen sharply in the aftermath of the Alaskan oil 
spill. The spill is temporarily helping the Alaskan economy, though 
not the ecology: fishermen are being paid $2,500 per day for use of 
their boats for cleanup activities. Oil and gas drilling activity 
reports are mixed but show some recent signs of strength. Dallas 
reports that the rotary rig count in the district was up sharply in 
March. Kansas City reports a decline in drilling rigs from February 
to March but a rebound in April.
          </p>
          <p>
           The lumber industry appears to be doing very well. Minneapolis and 
San Francisco report that the main problem is a shortage of 
available logs. Minneapolis also reports that environmental concerns 
have delayed logging activity. Reports on capital expenditure plans 
in this sector are mixed, with Minneapolis reporting substantial 
expansion in capacity but San Francisco reporting that lumber 
shortages have caused mills to reduce expenditure plans.
