           Reports from Federal Reserve Districts indicate 
                that economic growth slowed in December, easing labor shortages 
                somewhat and limiting price pressures for finished goods and services. 
                Most districts reported a further deceleration in growth from 
                the previous survey. Philadelphia reported an actual decline in 
                activity, while Cleveland said that economic growth remained at 
                the same slow rate as in the previous report. New York and San 
                Francisco indicated that growth remained solid but showed some 
                signs of softening.

          <p>
           Despite heavy discounting, nearly all districts reported lackluster 
                retail sales growth during the holiday season. Automobile sales 
                slowed substantially and most districts reported a sizable buildup 
                of dealer stocks. All districts reported weaker manufacturing 
                activity in December. Residential construction cooled in most 
                districts but remained strong in New York and San Francisco. Commercial 
                real estate activity also showed some signs of slowing. The tourism 
                industry reported a strong start to the winter season, but other 
                service activity weakened, particularly for trucking and other 
                transport. Activity in the energy sector expanded as fast as drillers 
                could find workers and rigs. Banks did not report any deterioration 
                in credit quality but kept a watchful eye over their loans.
          </p>
          <p>
           Labor markets eased somewhat but remained tight. Layoffs in 
                a wide variety of industries were announced in most districts. 
                However, business contacts expected laid-off workers to be quickly 
                reabsorbed due to strong pent-up demand for labor at other firms. 
                In most districts, wage pressures were similar to or slightly 
                less intense than those in the previous survey. Prices for most 
                manufactured goods were flat to down despite higher costs for 
                energy and other inputs. Consumer product prices were constrained 
                by heavy holiday discounting.
          </p>
          <p>
           <b>
            Consumer Spending
           </b>
           <br/>
           Holiday retail sales were disappointing in nearly all districts, 
                despite early and extensive discounting. Most districts reported 
                that sales were up only slightly from the holiday season a year 
                ago, when strong gains were reported. An exception was the New 
                York district, where sales increases were on or close to plan. 
                The overall weak sales growth led several national and regional 
                retailers to close some or all of their stores. Many districts 
                cited diminished consumer confidence as the biggest reason for 
                the slower growth in activity this December. Retailers in the 
                Richmond, Chicago, St. Louis, and Dallas districts reported that 
                brutally cold weather further dampened sales. Winter weather items 
                sold very well in December, as did apparel in most districts. 
                But sales of home furnishings, fine jewelry, computers, and most 
                other items lagged. Kansas City and San Francisco reported significant 
                growth in online retailing during the 2000 holiday season, although 
                the growth was below expectations in the San Francisco district. 
                Inventory levels were reported to be satisfactory to slightly 
                excessive in most districts. Managers seemed confident, however, 
                that any surpluses would be trimmed during January clearance sales. 
                Looking ahead, most store managers seemed cautiously optimistic 
                about retail sales in the first quarter of 2001.
          </p>
          <p>
           Automobile sales in all districts reporting on such activity 
                were characterized as either weak or slowing. Sales of domestic 
                cars and light trucks were reported to be especially weak in the 
                Philadelphia and Chicago districts. St. Louis noted that used 
                car dealerships experienced the largest decline in sales. Dealers 
                in the Kansas City district had difficulties moving all makes 
                and models of motor vehicles. Inventories of unsold cars throughout 
                the country were high, and in most districts expectations for 
                auto sales in coming months remained subdued.
          </p>
          <p>
           <b>
            Manufacturing
           </b>
           <br/>
           Manufacturing activity weakened in all districts in December. 
                Steel producers were reported to be in difficulty in many districts, 
                with Cleveland and Chicago reporting a number of bankruptcy filings 
                among steel firms. There were also announcements in several districts 
                of temporary auto assembly plant shutdowns in the first quarter. 
                Slower construction activity in recent months has precipitated 
                a dropoff in production of construction-related materials and 
                equipment in the Boston, Dallas, and San Francisco districts. 
                On a positive note, activity at many of the nation's refineries 
                remained solid. Production of computer-related equipment remained 
                strong in the Boston district, but Dallas reported a sharp falloff 
                in computer production, due to weaker consumer demand for PCs 
                and to reductions of technology-related investment by businesses.
          </p>
          <p>
           High input costs, the strong dollar, and weaker domestic demand 
                were cited the most often as reasons for the slowdown in factory 
                activity. Boston, Richmond, and St. Louis reported that higher 
                input costs were squeezing profits for some firms. Half the districts 
                also mentioned widespread concern among manufacturers about higher 
                energy costs. Some fertilizer, chemical, and smelting plants in 
                the St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City and San Francisco districts 
                have even shut down in order to resell their electricity or natural 
                gas supplies on the open market. Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, 
                Atlanta, and Kansas City reported that heavy import competition, 
                due largely to the strength of the dollar, was hampering manufacturing 
                sales. Atlanta also reported that uncertainty about the U.S. stock 
                market was adversely affecting firms' capital expenditure plans.
          </p>
          <p>
           <b>
            Real Estate and Construction
           </b>
           <br/>
           Residential real estate activity cooled in most districts. Single-family 
                residential construction remained strong in the New York and San 
                Francisco districts, but it declined in the St. Louis, Kansas 
                City, and Dallas districts and showed signs of slowing elsewhere. 
                Homebuilders in the Cleveland district reported that they have 
                far fewer projects scheduled for coming months than at the same 
                time last year. In contrast, builders in the New York district 
                reported a persistent backlog of projects. Home sales were mixed 
                across housing markets, with New York again reporting the most 
                robust activity. Boston and Richmond reported that reduced consumer 
                confidence was adversely affecting sales, with potential homebuyers 
                showing greater willingness to delay home purchases. Unusually 
                cold weather was also reported to have held down activity in some 
                districts.
          </p>
          <p>
           There were also signs of slowing in commercial real estate activity 
                in some districts. Commercial construction slowed in the Dallas, 
                Richmond, and Atlanta districts, and was described as mixed in 
                the St. Louis and Cleveland districts. Commercial building remained 
                solid in the Kansas City district. New York and Richmond reported 
                that contraction by dot-com enterprises has helped free up some 
                office space, although the office market in the New York district 
                remains very tight. Shortages of office space were also reported 
                in parts of the Richmond, St. Louis, and San Francisco districts.
          </p>
          <p>
           <b>
            Tourism and Services
           </b>
           <br/>
           Tourism was better than expected in those districts reporting 
                activity. Unusually cold weather and a good snow base boosted 
                visits to ski resorts in the Richmond and Minneapolis districts. 
                Atlanta also reported that holiday travel to Florida was very 
                strong.
          </p>
          <p>
           Activity in other service industries was generally down. Demand 
                for trucking services fell considerably in the New York and Cleveland 
                districts, and was down slightly in the Dallas district. Meanwhile, 
                trucking firms' fuel, insurance, and labor costs continued to 
                rise, resulting in an increase in bankruptcies and truck repossessions 
                in the New York district. St. Louis reported a slowdown in barge 
                traffic on the Mississippi River due to low water levels. Richmond 
                and Dallas reported that revenues fell at most business service 
                firms. In contrast, revenues were up in the Boston district's 
                insurance industry.
          </p>
          <p>
           <b>
            Financial Services
           </b>
           <br/>
           Bank loan growth slowed somewhat in most districts in December. 
                Bankers in the Cleveland district said decisions by some manufacturing 
                firms to delay investment projects had reduced demand for business 
                loans. Atlanta and Chicago also reported some slowing in business 
                loan demand. New York, Kansas City, and San Francisco reported 
                somewhat weaker demand for both consumer and business loans, while 
                Dallas reported that demand slowed for all categories except loans 
                to energy firms. Demand for home mortgages was mixed, but lenders 
                in several districts said they expect refinancing activity to 
                pick up if low mortgage rates persist.
          </p>
          <p>
           There were no new reports of decreases in credit quality, but 
                banks generally continued to tighten credit standards and said 
                they were keeping a watchful eye on the financial condition of 
                their borrowers. Banks in the New York, Philadelphia, Atlanta, 
                Chicago, and Dallas districts reported they were continuing to 
                tighten their credit standards. Banks in many districts also said 
                they were monitoring credit quality carefully to detect any deterioration. 
                Bankers in the Chicago district reported they were keeping an 
                especially close eye on loans to retail and manufacturing sectors, 
                while bankers in the Richmond district said they were paying special 
                attention to loans to cyclical industries.
          </p>
          <p>
           <b>
            Agriculture and Natural Resources
           </b>
           <br/>
           The energy sector continues to expand. Despite recent easing in 
                oil prices, contacts in the Dallas, Kansas City, and Minneapolis 
                districts reported that oil and natural gas prices remain sufficiently 
                high to promote continued expansion of exploration and production. 
                However, Dallas and Kansas City reported that the pace of industry 
                expansion is constrained by worker and equipment shortages. Given 
                these shortages, the recent dramatic rise in natural gas prices 
                is not expected to produce a further acceleration in drilling 
                activity. Other extraction industries are not doing as well, as 
                metal mining and processing activity in the Minneapolis district 
                continued to decline in the face of falling commodity prices and 
                high electricity costs.
          </p>
          <p>
           In the farm economy, the onset of winter weather across the 
                country has had mixed effects. Minneapolis reported that moisture 
                from heavy snowfalls has benefited the winter wheat crop and is 
                expected to reduce the likelihood of drought conditions in the 
                coming growing season. However, severe winter weather also contributed 
                to a worsening in pasture conditions for livestock and an increased 
                use of alternative forages in the Richmond, Minneapolis, Kansas 
                City, and Dallas districts. The alternative supplies seem to be 
                generally available except for some reports of hay shortages in 
                the Dallas district.

            Labor Markets, Wages, and Prices
           </b>
           <br/>
           Labor markets eased somewhat but remained tight in most districts. 
                Layoffs in a wide variety of industries were announced in most 
                districts. Due to strong pent-up demand for labor at other firms, 
                however, contacts in most districts expected laid-off workers 
                to be quickly reabsorbed. Contacts in the Boston, New York, Atlanta, 
                and Kansas City districts also expressed hope that recent dot-com 
                layoffs would alleviate the severe shortage of information technology 
                workers. Businesses that were still having difficulty finding 
                qualified workers included retailers in the New York and Cleveland 
                districts, construction firms in the New York and San Francisco 
                districts, and health care firms in the Atlanta district. In contrast, 
                service firms in the Chicago district said they were having more 
                success in finding qualified workers in the last few weeks of 
                the year, and firms in the St. Louis district reported that the 
                slowdown in demand in the district was making it easier to fill 
                vacancies.
          </p>
          <p>
           Wage pressures in most districts either held steady or decreased 
                slightly in response to the easing in labor markets. Chicago, 
                Dallas, Kansas City, and San Francisco all reported some moderation 
                in overall wage pressures. New York described wage pressures as 
                strong but steady, while Minneapolis reported that wages continued 
                to increase at a moderate pace. Despite the overall slowdown in 
                economic growth, a number of districts reported strong wage pressures 
                for certain types of workers, including information technology 
                workers in the Boston district, retail workers in the Richmond 
                district, construction workers in the San Francisco district, 
                and union workers in the Cleveland district.
          </p>
          <p>
           Price pressures for consumer goods were subdued, while prices 
                for most manufactured goods were flat to down despite higher input 
                costs. Extensive discounting by retailers during the holiday shopping 
                season helped constrain consumer prices in most districts. Retail 
                prices increased at a slower rate in the Richmond district, held 
                steady in the Boston district, and declined somewhat in the Kansas 
                City and Dallas districts.
          </p>
          <p>
           Manufacturers in many districts reported that their input costs 
                rose in December, especially for energy, but that they were unable 
                to pass these cost increases on to customers due to intense foreign 
                and domestic competition and slowing demand. The most notable 
                reports of downward pressure on selling prices were for steel 
                firms in the Cleveland and Chicago districts and for a wide variety 
                of manufacturing firms in the Dallas district, including producers 
                of metals, cement and concrete, paper, and lumber. In the service-producing 
                sector, telecommunications firms in the Dallas district reported 
                their prices were falling rapidly, but insurance firms in the 
                Boston district said that reduced price competition had enabled 
                them to raise premiums to more profitable levels.
