          Solid economic growth is reported in most parts of the country. In 
California, conditions remain weak, although some positive signs are 
starting to emerge. Reports from all Districts indicate that retail 
sales were strong in March, due in part to improved weather in many 
parts of the country. Retail pricing remains competitive, as few 
price increases and some price cuts are noted. Apparel sales 
improved, and auto sales are very strong. Service sector activity is 
reported to be good, with strength in business services and tourism. 
Manufacturing activity is expanding overall, although aerospace 
activity continues weak. Production of autos, vehicle parts, steel, 
and building materials is near capacity. Price increases are 
reported for some raw materials, but competitive pressures appear to
be restraining prices for most manufactured products. Agricultural 
conditions are good in most parts of the country. Oil drilling 
activity is down, but drilling for natural gas remains strong. Home 
sales activity is reported brisk in most parts of the country, and 
improving in the Northeast and California. Several Districts note 
that recent interest rate hikes have contributed to a temporary 
surge in home sales. Contacts indicate that lending activity is 
picking up, with greater strength in consumer lending than in 
business lending.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Retail Trade
          </strong>
          <br/>
          Several Districts report double-digit year-over-year increases in 
retail sales, as long-awaited spring weather in much of the country, 
combined with an early Easter, boosted March results. Philadelphia 
reports that healthy sales continued into early April. Improved 
apparel sales are noted in the New York, Cleveland, Atlanta, 
Chicago, and Kansas City Districts. Pricing remains very competitive 
in most areas, with few price increases and some price cuts for 
retail products. Dallas reports slow sales growth, with the 
strongest gains reported by retailers who have reduced their prices 
during the past year. No inventory surpluses or shortages are noted.
         </p>
         <p>
          Reports suggest that auto sales were very strong through early 
April. Inventories of some models are quite tight. Most Districts 
indicate that higher interest rates did not reduce auto sales 
through mid-April, although one Chicago District auto dealer saw a 
sharp decline in activity as interest rates rose and customers 
worried about their losses in the financial markets.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Services
          </strong>
          <br/>
          The service sector is generally healthy. Dallas reports growing 
demand in a wide range of business services, and San Francisco notes 
growing demand for telephone services in California and Washington. 
Contacts indicate that employers' health costs are rising more 
slowly, and health care providers are cutting their costs. Boston 
reports that hospitals are sharply reducing orders for large 
equipment.
         </p>
         <p>
          Hotel activity is strong in many tourist destinations throughout the 
West and Southeast, including Myrtle Beach, New Orleans, Las Vegas, 
and Salt Lake City, while activity is improving in many California 
markets and in Hawaii. In Florida, observers hope that very weak 
visitor activity from Europe will be offset by more tourism from the 
improving economies of Latin America and the Caribbean. In the 
northern Midwest, cold weather restrained winter resort activity, 
but industry officials are optimistic about the summer season, 
especially in Montana.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Manufacturing
          </strong>
          <br/>
          Manufacturing activity is expanding in most Districts, although the 
pace of activity is uneven across industries and regions. Many 
manufacturers in the Cleveland District report that demand from 
foreign buyers has improved. In the Richmond District, shipments, 
new orders, and backlogs grew, but employment changed little. In the 
Atlanta District, demand for apparel fabric appears to have 
improved. Electronic equipment manufacturers in Chicago and San 
Francisco Districts report healthy sales growth, but at rates 
somewhat slower than last year. The Chicago and Cleveland Districts 
note that vehicle manufacturing activity is at or near capacity. 
Several Districts report strong demand for building materials. 
Aerospace and defense-related manufacturing continues weak. San 
Francisco reports strong investment in computer and communications 
equipment, as companies replace outdated equipment in order to 
increase productivity and improve their competitive positions.
         </p>
         <p>
          Manufacturers note that competitive pressures are restraining prices 
for most products. However, significant price increases are reported 
for certain raw materials, including building materials. Chicago 
indicates that capacity constraints have led to price increases for 
special-order steel products, since extra production time must be 
set aside to fill these orders. Several manufacturers in the Boston, 
Richmond, Chicago, and St. Louis Districts have successfully 
resisted suppliers' price increases, but some have been forced to 
absorb the increased cost of materials.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Agriculture and Resource-Related Industries
          </strong>
          <br/>
          Favorable spring weather through the third week of April created 
good conditions for field preparation and planting in much of the 
country. In the Richmond and Minneapolis Districts, field 
preparation and planting were on schedule or ahead of schedule. In 
the Kansas City District, however, farmers were waiting for warmer 
and drier weather before planting corn and soybeans. Kansas City 
District cattle feedlots are operating near capacity, and cattle 
prices are up. The Dallas and San Francisco Districts report good 
agricultural activity, but dry weather and water supply restrictions 
are creating concerns. St. Louis notes that fertilizer prices have 
increased substantially during the past year.
         </p>
         <p>
          Low oil prices have led to reduced oil production and oil drilling 
activity in the Kansas City District. Natural gas prices declined 
slightly, but Dallas reports that drilling activity is very strong 
in the Gulf of Mexico, where more than 70 percent of drilling is for 
natural gas.
         </p>
         <p>
          &gt;Real Estate and Construction
          <br/>
          Home sales activity is reported brisk in most parts of the country, 
and improving in the Northeast and California, where activity had 
been weak. New homes are selling well in the New York and Atlanta 
Districts. A contact in the Chicago District reports that home-
buying traffic fell off during April after a strong first quarter. 
Real estate agents in the St. Louis District report a shortage of 
houses on the market, especially in the mid-price range, and note 
that many sellers are receiving two or more bids at the asking price 
or higher. Minneapolis reports tight housing markets in its 
District, with strong growth in new housing permits. In the Kansas 
City District, building and sales activity both are strong, and 
inventories of unsold homes are low. Several Districts report higher 
building materials costs. Through mid-April, higher interest rates 
appear to have generated a surge in activity, due in part to buyers' 
concerns that rates could rise further. Several respondents in 
various regions of the country expressed concern that higher 
interest rates could restrain activity later in the year.
         </p>
         <p>
          Major commercial construction projects are under way for the first 
time in several years in Manhattan. Office leasing activity in New 
York is reported to be "fairly brisk." Vacancy rates and leasing 
activity have improved in the Atlanta District as well. Strong 
commercial building activity also is noted in North Dakota, 
Wisconsin, South Dakota, and Montana.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Financial Institutions
          </strong>
          <br/>
          Several Districts report improved lending activity, with consumer 
lending generally characterized as stronger than business lending. 
In the Philadelphia District, consumer installment and credit card 
lending is reported up, while business lending is flat or increasing 
marginally. Mortgage lending for home purchases is up in many 
Districts, but refinancing activity has fallen sharply throughout 
the country.
