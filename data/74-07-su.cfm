            Although it may now be less appropriate than earlier this year to 
characterize the U.S. economy as one of general materials scarcity, 
reports from the Reserve Banks continue to emphasize this problem. A 
fair generalization may be that shortages of materials and 
components are still generally severe, although the availability of 
some items seems to be easing. Cleveland and Chicago both emphasize 
the tightness of supplies, and the spotty nature of the 
improvements. In the Richmond and Kansas City Districts, some 
materials are now more easily obtainable but only at much higher 
prices. The New York Bank reports no lessening of pressure on 
productive capacity. Its respondents expect some further moderation 
in basic commodity prices, but continued upward pressure on finished 
goods prices.
           </p>
           <p>
            The situation in the steel industry, as reported by the Chicago and 
Cleveland Banks, is of special interest. A shortage of steel is 
expected to be a major barrier to output increases in other 
industries, as demand for steel continues to exceed supply. (1974 
shipments are now expected to be below the 1973 total.) According to 
the Chicago Bank, "shipments have been maintained at recent high 
rates by further reducing mill inventories below levels thought to 
be rock bottom." The situation could tighten further because of 
equipment bottlenecks, and shortages of ore and coal. Demand for 
coal, from utilities as well as steel companies, is strong their 
stocks are low; and the overall supply situation is tight. Steel 
company officials are concerned about the possibility of a coal 
strike in November, which would severely disrupt operations. (An 
economist with a coal-producing firm considers it likely that there 
will be a coal strike in November of from 2 to 4 weeks duration.) 
Several Banks—including Chicago, Atlanta, and San Francisco—report 
increasing numbers of labor disputes and more strike activity. 
Construction in the Chicago District has been severely hampered by a 
strike of ready-mix-concrete truck drivers. Interwoven with the 
increasing amount of strike activity is the increasing number of 
large wage demands (and settlements), making the intensifying wage-push pressure on prices a matter of great concern.
           </p>
           <p>
            Capital spending remains generally, though not uniformly, strong. 
Chicago reports that demand for capital goods is well above output 
capabilities, and backlogs are rising in spite of all-out 
production; Cleveland also reports rising backlogs. Plant and 
equipment spending is behind schedule in the Atlanta District, but 
only because of capital goods delivery problems; capital spending 
plans remain strong across the District. In the Philadelphia 
District, however, manufacturers are taking a closer look at their 
plant and equipment spending plans and the outlook now is for a 
smaller increase in capital spending. Dallas, on the other hand, 
reports no significant revision of spending plans by large firms in 
its District. However, small businesses there are holding back on 
long-term expenditures because of the difficulty of getting bank 
financing and because of the high cost of funds.
           </p>
           <p>
            Both Chicago and Richmond report that some major electrical 
utilities are scaling down their expansion plans. Chicago states 
that financing problems are to a large extent responsible for the 
cancellation of some projects, and Richmond notes the announcement 
of cutbacks, postponements, and review of plans by several 
electrical utilities in its District.
           </p>
           <p>
            Eight of the twelve Banks refer in this Red Book to the continuing 
serious plight of the residential construction industry. The Chicago 
report is most blunt: "Housing is in a severe recession, with hopes 
dashed for a revival in 1974." The story is much the same for the 
Districts commenting: building permits off drastically; savings 
inflows to, and mortgage lending by, thrift institutions, very weak; 
construction sluggish and no recovery in sight. Indirect effects are 
also mentioned. San Francisco notes that the lumber and plywood 
industry is "marking time", waiting for a pickup in housing. 
Richmond reports that the sustained decline in residential 
construction has meant a 20 percent reduction this year in orders to 
the furniture industry.
           </p>
           <p>
            Only Minneapolis, St. Louis, and Atlanta report some improvement in 
retail sales, or consumer spending in general. Cleveland and 
Philadelphia refer to weak or sluggish consumer spending, as does 
Richmond for big-ticket items. Several Banks report that retail 
inventories are considered excessive by their respondents. Views of 
a number of retailers range from uncertain to pessimistic for sales 
during the rest of the year. Tourist business has been "lackluster" 
in New England and slow in the Mountain states of the Kansas City 
District, but tourism is on the upswing all across the Atlanta 
District and the industry's outlook for the rest of the summer is 
good in the Minneapolis District.
           </p>
           <p>
            Loan expansion by commercial banks continues to be limited by tight 
credit conditions, with deposit growth slowing down. Philadelphia 
reports loan demand as firm, held down primarily by restrictive loan 
policies rather than by adverse publicity. Business loan demand is 
characterized as strong by Atlanta, and by Minneapolis, where no 
let-up is foreseen. Richmond and Cleveland also report strong demand 
for business credit, with their banks becoming increasingly 
selective in allocating scarce funds. Kansas City and St. Louis 
detect some weakening in the rate of growth of demand for commercial 
loans. "Lackluster growth" summarizes the comments on recent 
deposits behavior, by Philadelphia, Atlanta, Kansas City, St. Louis, 
Minneapolis, and Richmond.
           </p>
           <p>
            Boston's Eckstein and Samuelson warn of the dangers of overly tight 
money. New York respondents worry that the country is nearing 
serious trouble as the strains on liquidity increase. In Atlanta, 
apprehensive businessmen are reacting to the rumors of little 
liquidity in banks, while nonbank respondents for San Francisco call 
commercial banks "dangerously illiquid." Meanwhile, most 
Philadelphia banks have been able to roll over their CD's without 
major difficulties.
           </p>
           <p>
            Concern with the agricultural price situation is recorded by several 
Districts. Richmond and Atlanta report that poultry and cattle 
producers are caught in a severe cost-price squeeze. Kansas City, 
Dallas, and San Francisco comment further on the troubled cattle 
industry. Minneapolis and Kansas City explain the recent turnaround 
of grain prices as being partly due to the uncertain effects of 
unfavorable spring weather on the corn and soybean crops. Offsetting 
the bad farm news, San Francisco points to the high price for sugar 
beets, and Kansas City reports a good wheat harvest in progress.
