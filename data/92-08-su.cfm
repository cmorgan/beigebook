           Economic activity has been uneven in recent weeks across the nation. 
Manufacturing increased moderately in most districts and showed no 
discernable direction in others, with considerable variation by 
industry. Retail sales also varied widely, but apparently rose 
modestly overall. Lower interest rates sparked another round of 
mortgage refinancing, but evidently provided little impetus to 
residential and commercial real estate activity. Consumer and 
business loan demand strengthened in only a few regions while 
remaining weak in most of the country. Agricultural conditions 
improved slightly as recent rains helped crops in many areas.
          </p>
          <p>
           Consumer Spending
District reports suggested that retail activity improved somewhat in 
recent weeks. Sales activity varied by product and region. Apparel 
sales were reported to be strong by New York and Kansas City, but 
weak by Philadelphia. New York and Kansas City also noted increased 
sales of home furnishings; Minneapolis and Atlanta indicated 
depressed appliance sales. Automobile sales evidently were weak in 
most districts except Atlanta and Dallas, where they were strong. 
Tourist activity was flat in the Richmond district but showed some 
strength in the Minneapolis district.
          </p>
          <p>
           The expectations of retailers varied from district to district. 
Philadelphia, Richmond, Chicago, Kansas City, and Dallas indicated 
that their contacts were optimistic about prospects for sales in the 
months ahead, while San Francisco said retailers were less 
optimistic than earlier this year. Survey respondents from the New 
York district were cautious but hopeful in their outlooks, and 
Cleveland reported retailer uncertainty about sales prospects. 
Retailers in the Boston district anticipated no substantial change 
in activity in the months immediately ahead.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Manufacturing
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Manufacturing continued to improve moderately in most districts, 
while the direction of activity was unclear in the Boston and St. 
Louis districts. Cleveland and Chicago noted that manufacturing 
continued to lead their regions' economic recoveries. Philadelphia, 
Richmond, Atlanta, and Chicago indicated that new orders had risen. 
Philadelphia and Richmond added that shipments had risen as well and 
that manufacturers expected activity to increase further in the next 
six months. Cleveland and Chicago anticipated increased automobile 
production in the current quarter. Manufacturing employment 
apparently changed little in the Boston, Philadelphia, Richmond, and 
St. Louis districts, but Atlanta reported some increases in 
production workers.
          </p>
          <p>
           Some industries performed better than others. Atlanta and Dallas 
noted strong gains in activity among apparel manufacturers and among 
producers of goods for residential construction. Boston and San 
Francisco reported weakness in defense-related and aerospace 
industries, but Boston found strength in demand among suppliers to 
the automobile industry.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Residential Real Estate
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Home sales and home building activity in recent weeks varied by 
region but appeared on balance unchanged for the nation as a whole. 
Cleveland and St. Louis reported decreased sales, and Richmond 
indicated that sales were flat. Atlanta, Chicago, and Minneapolis, 
however, reported increased sales, as did San Francisco for all 
states except California, where sales were weak.
          </p>
          <p>
           Residential construction activity rose in the Chicago and Dallas 
districts, and in the San Francisco district outside of California. 
Homebuilding activity decreased in the St. Louis district and was 
generally unchanged in the Atlanta and Kansas City districts and in 
California. New York and Minneapolis indicated mixed activity in 
their districts.
          </p>
          <p>
           Cleveland, Richmond, Kansas City, and Dallas said that lower 
interest rates were not spurring home buying, although Chicago 
indicated that lower rates were helping. In the New York and 
Richmond districts, real estate agents mentioned that the job 
security concerns of potential home buyers were continuing to dampen 
sales.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Nonresidential Construction
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Nonresidential construction activity generally remained sluggish. 
Atlanta noted that most activity stemmed from either private custom-
built or government projects. New York and Richmond, however, 
indicated that some new commercial projects were underway. 
Minneapolis, Dallas, and San Francisco reported continued depressed 
commercial real estate prices. Office building vacancy rates in the 
New York district, while still high, evidently fell in recent weeks 
as rents became more competitive. Dallas and San Francisco indicated 
that commercial property was selling far below construction costs.
          </p>
          <p>
           Lower interest rates apparently had had little effect on commercial 
real estate loan activity. The demand for these leans was reported 
to be flat or down by Richmond, Kansas City, and San Francisco, and 
steady to somewhat higher by New York.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Financial
           </strong>
           <br/>
           On balance, financial conditions improved slightly across the nation 
over the past six weeks. Loan demand was characterized as stronger 
by Richmond, Chicago, and Kansas City and described as stable by New 
York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Atlanta, St. Louis, Dallas, and San 
Francisco. Commercial loan demand continued to exhibit weakness, 
although Richmond and Kansas City cited some improvement. Among 
districts consenting on consumer loan demand, Philadelphia, Atlanta, 
and Kansas City registered increases, while New York, Richmond, and 
St. Louis reported no change. Among loan categories, home mortgages 
exhibited the greatest strength in most districts, but the bulk of 
the activity was attributed to refinancing, which picked up somewhat 
in early July. Atlanta and Chicago noted that some banks were more 
aggressive in seeking new loans, but Boston found that small 
businesses were still choosing to obtain credit from nonbank 
sources.
          </p>
          <p>
           Lenders in the Philadelphia and Dallas districts expected loan 
demand to be flat over the next few months. Boston, Philadelphia, 
and Chicago cited the continuing reluctance of bank customers, 
particularly businesses, to take on new debt.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Inventories
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Inventory conditions varied across the country. Reports of retail 
inventories were especially disparate. Philadelphia and Chicago 
reported levels below and in line with plans, respectively. Atlanta 
reported retail inventories to be at historically low levels. 
Inventories in manufacturing edged up in the Philadelphia district, 
and were unchanged in the Richmond district. Dallas district 
manufacturers described their inventories as high. Both Kansas City 
and Dallas respondents expected inventory levels to fall in the 
weeks ahead.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Prices and Costs
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Richmond and Kansas City indicated small increases in the prices 
charged by retailers and manufacturers in recent weeks, while other 
districts reported little change. Manufacturers' input prices were 
stable, although Richmond, St. Louis, and Dallas noted increases in 
business and production costs. Construction costs rose in the Kansas 
City and Minneapolis districts. St. Louis, Dallas, and San Francisco 
reported recent declines in lumber prices, while Kansas City 
reported increases. Dallas indicated increases in the prices of 
chemicals, petroleum, and steel. Minneapolis and San Francisco 
reported greater-than-average increases in health care costs.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Agriculture and Natural Resources
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Conditions in agriculture were slightly improved. In the Richmond, 
Chicago, and St. Louis districts, and in areas of the Kansas City 
district, recent rains have brought relief to heat- and drought-
stressed crops. Dallas reported that crops in the district had 
benefited from a return to more normal weather. Damage to wheat was 
reported in the San Francisco district, however, where dry 
conditions in the Pacific Northwest reduced yields, and in the 
Chicago district, where too much rain harmed the crop. Minneapolis 
and Kansas City reported that hail had harmed some crops and that 
crop development had been slowed by unseasonably cool weather. In 
the livestock sector, Chicago indicated increased hog production,
and Kansas City reported that cattle herds were expanding slowly.
          </p>
          <p>
           Movements in farm prices varied. Crop prices were reported to be 
above last year's levels by Minneapolis but declining in the Dallas 
district. Livestock prices were lower in the Chicago, Minneapolis, 
and Kansas City districts but stable in the Dallas district. Chicago 
indicated that milk prices were up.
          </p>
          <p>
           Energy activity in the nation evidently continued to contract in 
recent weeks. The drilling rig count declined substantially in the 
Kansas City district, where activity was near historically low 
levels, but rose somewhat in the Dallas district. Oil industry 
respondents in the Dallas district indicated that they were cutting 
domestic exploration spending.
