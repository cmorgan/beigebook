           Reports by business and banking sources contacted by Federal Reserve 
districts suggest that activity was lackluster as the year drew to a 
close. Retailers in most districts report that holiday sales were at 
or modestly above year-ago levels before adjustment for price 
changes. Manufacturing sources generally note steady or declining 
production and employment. Except for export goods, orders and 
backlogs generally softened into 1992. According to realtors, lower 
mortgage rates have aided home sales, particularly of lower-priced 
properties. Single-family construction expanded modestly, while new 
commercial activity remained dormant. Aside from a surge in mortgage 
refinancing, banking sources suggest that consumer and business loan 
demand has not revived. Bankers report no change in credit 
standards. While some bank contacts report ongoing loan quality 
problems, others are optimistic about prospects for improvement as 
borrowers work down debt service burdens. Energy industry contacts 
confirm that lower oil and natural gas prices are leading to cuts in 
expenditures for drilling and energy-related products. District 
reports indicate that commodity and materials prices were generally 
unchanged or declining; pressures on wages and retail prices have 
been minimal. Despite softness as the new year began, business and 
banking contacts generally anticipate that economic conditions will 
improve by mid-year.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Consumer Spending
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Retailers generally confirmed that holiday sales were flat to 
slightly higher than year-ago 1evels before adjustment for 
inflation. Discounters and some specialty stores posted better 
performance at the expense of traditional department stores. Sources 
in Atlanta, Cleveland, Kansas City, Minneapolis, and Dallas report 
modest sales gains led by nondurable goods, particularly basic 
apparel and other small-ticket items. Sales in several districts 
were below expectations, and retailers in the Philadelphia district 
have continued to cut prices through early January.
          </p>
          <p>
           Inventories held by retailers in Chicago, Cleveland, Dallas, and 
Philadelphia were above target levels in early January, while 
retailers in Atlanta, New York, and Kansas City were content with 
current inventories. Retail contacts generally do not plan to expand 
stocks aggressively in the first quarter.
          </p>
          <p>
           According to auto dealers, new car sales were generally weak in 
Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Kansas City, and San Francisco districts. 
However, Minneapolis and Cleveland report some improvement in auto 
and truck sales.
          </p>
          <p>
           Retailers and auto dealers generally expect sales to recover in 
1992, but not until the second half of the year. Strict inventory 
control, competitive pricing, and continued cost-cutting were cited 
by several districts as the general strategy for the near future.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Manufacturing
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Factory activity faltered in most districts through early 1992 
according to those surveyed. Renewed weakness in production and 
orders was cited by most contacts. Dallas contacts report that 
chemical production is flat and demand for oil field machinery is 
declining with oil prices. Weak auto output has hurt auto suppliers, 
according to Cleveland and Atlanta. Chicago also cites continued 
weakness in auto production and few signs of a turnaround in orders 
for appliances, heavy equipment, or primary metals.
          </p>
          <p>
           St. Louis and Atlanta report stable or increasing demand for 
packaging materials, where some price increases are sticking. Export 
demand continues to rise for some firms, according to sources in 
Kansas City, Boston, Richmond, and St. Louis. Manufacturers in 
Philadelphia report steady industrial output.
          </p>
          <p>
           Boston contacts indicate that capital spending is restrained by 
adequate or excess capacity and concerns about debt. Cleveland 
sources confirm that capital goods orders recently declined. Plants 
are generally operating below capacity, according to industry 
contacts in Kansas City, and Dallas chemical producers are concerned 
about overcapacity. Several districts report that, despite recent 
reductions in interest rates, capital expenditures will remain at 
1991 levels until economic conditions improve, although there were 
several reports of productivity-enhancing capital projects.
          </p>
          <p>
           Kansas City, Philadelphia, Atlanta, and Richmond report generally 
stable prices for material inputs and products. Factory product 
prices are flat in the Boston district; the weakest lines are being 
discounted.
          </p>
          <p>
           Inventories in the Kansas City and Philadelphia districts continue 
to drift downward, though no district reports excessive inventories 
as a major problem. Plans to expand stocks are conspicuously absent. 
Manufacturers' general expectations for the first quarter are for 
continued weak sales and flat prices, but sources are relatively 
uniform in expecting significant improvement in sales and production 
in the second half of 1992.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Real Estate and Construction
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Realtors in most regions report that lower mortgage rates have 
prompted modest gains in home sales. In Atlanta and New York, real 
estate contacts note that a significant portion of the home sales 
originated with first-time buyers and lower-priced properties. Sales 
in the Boston and Richmond districts remained mostly flat over the 
past six weeks. Except in the San Francisco district, which reports 
some continued decline, sources in most areas find home prices to be 
relatively stable.
          </p>
          <p>
           Reports from St. Louis, Kansas City, Dallas, and Atlanta note some 
improvement in single-family starts, but starts in the New York 
district remain slow due to generally sluggish demand. Multifamily 
activity remains stalled in Atlanta but is accelerating in Dallas.
          </p>
          <p>
           Realtors, mortgage lenders and home builders are generally 
optimistic for the spring. Bankers in Philadelphia, Cleveland, and 
Kansas City believe residential mortgage activity could post healthy 
gains. Atlanta realtors expect strengthening sales and St. Louis 
builders believe that conditions will improve significantly by mid-
1992.
          </p>
          <p>
           In the Dallas district, industrial and office real estate demand is 
flat. Office leasing declined in the New York area since the last 
report. Commercial activity in the Minneapolis district as mixed. 
Dallas and St. Louis report moderate increases in public 
construction.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Banking and Finance
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Aside from a surge in mortgage refinancing, most districts report 
consumer and business loan demand has not expanded significantly. 
Contacts in several districts say that households are refinancing 
from adjustable-rate to fixed-rate mortgages. San Francisco also 
suggested that savings from lower monthly payments are being used 
for household debt reduction. Gains in new mortgage activity are 
much spottier. Demand for other consumer and business loans was 
generally reported flat or down.
          </p>
          <p>
           Reports on loan quality were mixed. New York contacts report 
increased delinquency rates on all types of loans, forcing some 
restructuring. San Francisco found that bank profits are still 
restrained by deteriorating real estate loans. Philadelphia bankers 
expect improving portfolio quality as lower interest rates reduce 
debt service costs. Bankers in Atlanta noted either stabilization or 
improvement in the quality of their portfolios during the fourth 
quarter.
          </p>
          <p>
           Credit standards, on balance, remain unchanged. The consensus among 
banking contacts is that aggregate loan demand will remain flat 
until the second or third quarter of 1992.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Agriculture and Natural Resources
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Winter crops are generally said to be in good condition across the 
nation with the exception of the Dallas district, which reported 
severe weather damage to agricultural production. Livestock 
producers in several districts are struggling with lower prices.
          </p>
          <p>
           Declining oil and gas prices have resulted in reduced drilling 
activity in the Kansas City and Dallas districts. Dallas reported 
that lower prices are creating a somber energy outlook for 1992 and 
added that some producers are shifting exploration overseas, while 
many energy and related companies have announced layoffs.
