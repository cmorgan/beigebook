          <strong>
           January 11, 1978
          </strong>
         </p>
         <p align="left">
          The overall impression that emerges from this month's Current 
  Economic Comments is one of no significant change over the past 
  month in the business and financial situation. According to these 
  reports, retailers in most Districts enjoyed a good to excellent 
  Christmas selling season, although the sale of domestically produced 
  autos continued weak. Retail inventories are generally at or even 
  below desired levels, and manufacturing inventories are in line with 
  sale expectations. Residential construction remains strong. There 
  were further, albeit limited, indications of a strengthening of 
  business plant and equipment expenditures. No significant 
  disintermediation has developed, although savings inflows apparently 
  have slowed down. Demand for bank credit, notably consumer loans, 
  was strong.
         </p>
         <p align="left">
          Virtually all Districts report a good to excellent Christmas selling 
  season at non-auto retailers, with business generally exceeding 
  already high expectations. Sales thus are characterized as "fantastic" by some Boston respondents, and as breaking all records 
  by Atlanta. A good to excellent selling season is reported by 
  Cleveland, Chicago, San Francisco, New York, and Minneapolis and as 
  substantially above expectations by Dallas. A number of Districts 
  report continued brisk sales since Christmas, including Chicago, 
  Philadelphia, Atlanta, Boston and San Francisco. Sluggish auto 
  sales, however, are reported in about half of the reports. Among 
  others, Chicago reports December auto sales to have been a distinct 
  disappointment, while St. Louis and New York also note that such 
  sales have been less than expected. Auto dealers in the Dallas 
  District look for sales of the 1978 models to exceed those of the 
  1977 models, but Cleveland characterizes prospects for new car sales 
  and production as "highly uncertain". Continued strong sales of 
  imported cars, however, are noted in Atlanta, Dallas and New York. 
  Regarding consumer outlay on tourism, a good ski season is reported 
  by Boston and San Francisco.
         </p>
         <p align="left">
          The high level of non-auto retail sales has apparently reduced 
  retail inventories to desired levels, indeed in a number of cases to 
  below such levels. Boston thus reports that strong Christmas sales 
  has enabled retailers to work off any excess stocks that may have 
  developed earlier, while Dallas reports inventory levels to have 
  been drawn down to low levels at many stores. Similar sentiments are 
  expressed by respondents in the Cleveland and San Francisco 
  Districts. Chicago characterizes current retail inventory positions 
  as on the "slim side", St. Louis as "trim", Minneapolis and New York 
  as posing no problems, and Philadelphia and Richmond as consistent 
  with sale expectations. Similarly, according to several reports, 
  inventories at the manufacturing level are generally well balanced. 
  Manufacturing respondents in the Kansas District thus reported their 
  inventories as neither excessive nor inadequate, while Boston 
  respondents felt inventories were unlikely to create problems. 
  Philadelphia manufacturers plan to maintain their inventories at 
  current levels, while St. Louis reports manufacturing inventories 
  excluding autos to be generally in line with expected sales. 
  However, the view that inventories are too high is widely held among 
  manufacturers in the Richmond District.
         </p>
         <p align="left">
          Residential construction remains strong, according to those reports 
  that comment on this sector. Atlanta perceives an acceleration in 
  the pace of such construction, led by single-family units but with 
  quickening of the rate at which apartment projects are coming on 
  stream as vacancies dwindle and rents climb. St. Louis reports home 
  building to be strong, with recent home sales in some areas of the 
  District the largest in several years for the winter season. 
  Minneapolis notes that home building in its District has remained 
  well above the previous record pace of 1972, and is expected to 
  remain strong in the coming months, while housing experts in the 
  Chicago District also believe home building will be strong again in 
  1978.
         </p>
         <p align="left">
          Regarding business capital outlays, Chicago reports that the demand 
  for most types of capital goods has continued in a modest uptrend, 
  and that a majority of purchasing agents in areas heavily 
  emphasizing capital goods production expect improved conditions this 
  year. Similarly, capital goods producers in the Cleveland District 
  expect business to be as good or better this year than in 1977, with 
  a sharp step-up in capital spending in the aerospace and 
  communication industries. Respondents in New York and Cleveland note 
  that currently ample capacity obviates the need for additional 
  investment in the chemical industry, but Boston reports increased 
  capital goods orders by that industry. Dallas reports that many oil 
  field machinery and equipment manufacturers are expanding production 
  facilities.
         </p>
         <p align="left">
          No significant change on balance appears to have occurred in 
  manufacturing output and sales, which in general continued to 
  advance. An improvement in the steel industry is noted by several 
  banks, including Chicago, Cleveland and St. Louis. Philadelphia 
  reports that the strike in the coal industry as yet has had little 
  effect on the District's economy, although Richmond reports the 
  strike to be a major factor in the District's economy.
         </p>
         <p align="left">
          On the banking scene, no indications of significant 
  disintermediation have emerged, although a low or slower rate of 
  growth in time deposits and passbook saving accounts is noted by 
  several Banks, including Richmond, Cleveland, St. Louis and Dallas. 
  Concern was expressed by some respondents, however, that such 
  disintermediation would occur should money rates rise much further. 
  The demand for credit continues strong, particularly for consumer 
  and real estate loans.
