           Economic activity remained weak in much of the nation, but there 
were some indications that the decline may be bottoming out. Retail 
sales were sluggish in most districts, with no sustained pickup 
following the end of the Persian Gulf war. Manufacturing showed 
indications of stabilizing, with some districts reporting slightly 
improved conditions and increased optimism about future activity. 
Other districts, however, report continued weakness in 
manufacturing. Wage increases appear modest and input prices in 
manufacturing are reported to be flat or down. Larger price 
increases continue, however, in certain service industries such as 
health care. Residential real estate activity improved across the 
nation, while non-residential construction remained weak. Loan 
demand was reported flat or slightly improving by most districts. 
Agricultural conditions outside of California are reported to be 
generally good. Stable oil prices and low natural gas prices are 
reducing exploration.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Consumer Spending
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Retail sales remained sluggish in most districts, with the majority 
reporting no sustained pickup following the end of the Persian Gulf 
war. Districts report that renewed consumer confidence has yet to be 
translated into solid sales. Shoppers are remaining cautious and 
traffic is slow. Some softening of sales was reported by 
Philadelphia, Chicago, and Dallas. Cleveland reported a pickup in 
activity in areas not affected by auto layoffs, spurred in part by 
aggressive promotion. Increases also were noted in St. Louis for 
heavily promoted and discounted goods. Increased auto sales are 
noted by Kansas City, Cleveland, and Atlanta, but most districts 
reported little improvement and Dallas reported sharply reduced auto 
sales.
          </p>
          <p>
           Low expectations for a significant improvement in sales are reported 
in Philadelphia and New York. Boston reports that the prevailing 
expectation among retailers is that 1991 will continue to he a tough 
year. Atlanta notes that some retailers fear that increased activity 
in their district may be "catch up" spending and not permanent. San 
Francisco, however, reports that expectations for improved consumer 
spending rose substantially. Richmond also reports increased 
optimism among retailers. Retail inventories are reported to be lean 
in most districts.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Manufacturing
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Manufacturing activity showed signs of bottoming out in much of the 
nation. Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, 
Atlanta, Chicago, and Kansas City all report stable or slightly 
improving conditions. Weaker conditions were reported by Dallas and 
St. Louis. Most districts report manufacturing input prices to be 
flat or down.
          </p>
          <p>
           Cleveland noted some slow recovery in auto production, while Chicago 
reported an increase in orders received by suppliers to the auto 
industry. St. Louis, however, reported continued layoffs in the auto 
sector and a plant shutdown expected in May. Cleveland reports that 
steel production is expected to remain at 70 to 75 percent of 
capacity. Specialty steel and machine tool producers appear to be 
doing better than in previous recessions. Optimism among 
manufacturers for improvement was reported by Philadelphia, 
Richmond, and Cleveland.
          </p>
          <p>
           Cleveland, Kansas City, and San Francisco reported strength in 
export activity. Richmond indicated that exports at District ports 
were higher than in the previous year and are expected to increase 
further. Boston, however, indicated disappointing export activity. 
Contacts in Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco expect orders 
related to the rebuilding of Kuwait.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Construction and Real Estate
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Residential real estate activity improved across the nation, with 
most districts noting increased sales of new and existing single-
family homes and modest improvements in residential construction. 
Increased buyer interest was attributed to renewed confidence 
following the end of the Persian Gulf war, and to the decline in 
mortgage interest rates. Atlanta, however, reported that some 
builders are skeptical whether the increased housing demand is 
sustainable.
          </p>
          <p>
           Nonresidential construction activity remains weak. Boston reported 
that construction of new commercial space has nearly ground to a 
halt, but that vacancy rates continue to increase due to further 
contraction in the financial services industry. New York reported 
that office leasing activity in midtown Manhattan declined to its 
lowest level in three years. Vacancy rates rose in downtown 
Manhattan with the addition of new space. High vacancy rates also 
were reported in Los Angeles and in Minneapolis/St. Paul. Dallas 
reported that construction activity remains sluggish, with 
respondents attributing weakness to credit conditions and 
uncertainty over the actions of the Resolution Trust Corporation.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Banking and Finance
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Loan demand was reported to be flat or improving slightly in the 
eight districts reporting on financial developments. Increases were 
reported in mortgage lending and refinancings. Commercial and 
industrial loan demand was reported weak by Philadelphia, but 
slightly increasing by Richmond. In general, loan demand was 
expected to improve with the economy.
          </p>
          <p>
           Reports on credit availability are mixed. New York reports that a 
majority of their surveyed banks have not changed their credit 
standards over the last three months, but a few are more cautious 
with respect to lend development loans. Atlanta reports that most 
contacts feel that tight lending conditions continue to restrict 
loan growth. Boston indicates that half of their contacts report 
that a lack of credit is hampering capital spending, while the other 
half report ample credit for projects such as renovations and 
computer upgrades.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Agriculture and Natural Resources
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Dallas reported that prices for cotton, grain sorghum and soybeans 
have increased, and producers are indicating they will plant more 
acreage for these crops. According to Kansas City, warm weather has 
resulted in rapid development of the winter wheat crop, which is in 
generally good condition. Kansas City reports dry soil conditions in 
the western part of their district, and Minneapolis reports below 
normal precipitation in South Dakota. Favorable planting weather is 
reported by St. Louis and Richmond. In California, the freeze in 
late December cut citrus fruit production and exports in half and 
destroyed many fruit and nut trees. Continued drought conditions 
have caused farmers to cut back on acreage planted for many crops, 
including a 15 to 20 percent drop in cotton acreage planted in the 
San Joaquin valley.
          </p>
          <p>
           Kansas City reports that stable oil prices since the end of the 
Persian Gulf conflict have resulted in continued development of 
existing reserves, but current prices are not stimulating much 
exploration. Drilling activity fell in March but remained about 13 
percent above its year-ago level. Dallas reports dampened oil and 
gas production and drilling efforts. While oil prices are little 
changed from a year earlier, natural gas prices are the lowest in 
several years.
