            Though some areas remain strong, economic weakness appeared to be 
spreading, even before the coal strike began. The consensus is a 
deterioration in economic conditions since last month's reports, 
with the earliest chances for a recovery in mid-1975 and then only a 
mild upturn. The drop in residential construction has spread to many 
other industries, such as timber and lumber, furniture, and 
textiles. Auto and auto-related manufacturing industries are also 
depressed because of the resistance to buying the new model cars. 
Plant closings, job layoffs, and, in some cases, bankruptcies have 
resulted. The regions hardest hit are those where these industries 
predominate: the East, Midwest, and Southeast. Other manufacturing 
industries, particularly capital goods, report continued strong 
demand. However, some softening may be starting in these industries, 
with an easing of new machine tool orders and cutbacks or 
postponements of capital-spending plans reported from some 
Districts.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Consumer spending, particularly for big-ticket items, is 
off. Reports indicate that consumers are increasingly becoming more 
price-conscious and purchasing more heavily sale merchandise. 
Production and general sales declines have resulted in easier 
availability of many materials in short supply only a few months ago 
and, in some cases, lower materials prices. Only a few items are 
still in short supply. There was near-universal accord that because 
of sales declines and the greater availability of basic materials, 
manufacturing and wholesale and retail trade inventories are now too 
high. Realignment of these inventories will slow economic activity 
through the early part of next year. Bank lending has leveled off in 
most Districts because of a decline in loan demand and more 
restrictive loan requirements. Savings and loans inflows were 
reported in several Districts but are not expected to give any 
immediate relief to housing. A number of favorable crop reports were 
received, but livestock producers are still caught in a cost-price 
squeeze.
           </p>
           <p>
            Plant closings and layoffs are now appearing more frequently in 
District reports. Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, and St. Louis all 
report production cutbacks, plant closings, and layoffs by a wide 
range of manufacturers-such as autos, mobile homes, appliances, 
televisions, furniture, textiles, bicycles, and electrical 
components. Many of these cutbacks are related to the decline in 
housing, although a general fall-off in demand is also responsible. 
Lumber producers in the Atlanta and San Francisco Districts have 
been severely hit by the decline in residential construction. Lumber 
demand is practically nonexistent. Some areas have escaped 
substantial layoffs, however. Both Minneapolis and Kansas City 
Districts report only a slight rise in unemployment. They do not 
expect the situation to worsen significantly in the near future.
           </p>
           <p>
            Capital goods industries remain the most buoyant. But even here more 
signs of cutbacks and postponements were reported. Cleveland reports 
machine tool orders still are strong, but a number of spending 
programs for 1975 have been cut back. Atlanta, Chicago, and Kansas 
City report similar cut backs. Capital equipment orders in the 
Chicago District have fallen off recently, and stretch-outs of 
orders have also become more common. A Richmond survey shows that 
one-third of its respondents now consider capital-spending plans 
excessive. Orders remain strong for steel and other types of capital 
goods, however.
           </p>
           <p>
            There is growing evidence of a general weakening in demand for most 
consumer items. Auto sales are uniformly poor in all Districts. Most 
big-ticket items are not selling well. Only Minneapolis reports any 
strength in higher-priced consumer goods. Reports from San 
Francisco, Dallas, Boston, New York, Atlanta, and Philadelphia 
suggest that price cutting and sales campaigns by retailers and 
discount shopping by consumers are now more commonly practiced. 
Expectations about Christmas sales range from optimistic in 
Minneapolis and Dallas to Boston's report of no expected change in 
sales from last Christmas.
           </p>
           <p>
            Shortages have apparently eased considerably according to reports. 
Boston, Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, and San Francisco all indicate 
that many shortages are abating. Cleveland notes that the greater 
supply availability has led to a moderation of materials prices. 
Several Districts report continued shortages of steel and petroleum-base products; but in the Chicago and San Francisco Districts, even 
these shortages have moderated. The coal strike will create new 
shortages, but it is too early to tell how severe these will be.
           </p>
           <p>
            Excessive inventories and the need for inventory realignment appear 
to be on many businessmen's minds. Excessive inventories are the 
result of both declining sales and the easing of shortages. Dallas 
reports higher-than-desired retail store inventories are attributed 
in part to declining sales but also to overshipments by suppliers 
who are themselves trying to reduce inventories. Concern over 
shortages has dramatically given way to attempts to reduce 
inventories, according to Chicago's report. In the Kansas City 
District, the attempt to reduce inventories was one reason cited for 
the flatness in bank loan demand.
           </p>
           <p>
            Most Districts report that loan demand has begun to ease. 
Philadelphia notes that loan commitments have fallen both because of 
a decline in demand as well as more restrictive lending policies by 
many banks. Business loan demand appears to be off the most. San 
Francisco indicates that many large borrowers are returning to the 
capital markets. Minneapolis is the only District reporting 
continued strong loan demand because of agricultural borrowing. 
Inflows to time and savings accounts at commercial banks are 
beginning in many Districts. Funds are also beginning to flow back 
into savings and loan institutions. The Kansas City report indicates 
that savings and loan associations are beginning to see a return to 
"black ink." New York also notes an inflow but doesn't believe it 
will significantly improve the housing situation in the near future.
