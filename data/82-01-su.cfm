           <strong>
            January 27, 1982
           </strong>
          </p>
         </center>
         <p>
          According to this month's district reports, economic activity in the 
nation remains very weak. Retail sales, after finishing 1981 with a 
robust performance, have sagged again, and prospects for a quick 
recovery are not widely perceived. Auto sales are down across the 
country. In the manufacturing sector, softness cuts across 
geographic and industry lines, as unwanted stock piles up and leads 
to production cutbacks. Financial institutions say business loan 
demand continues to be strong, but consumer borrowing is still in 
the doldrums. Deposit flows are mixed, and response to IRAs has been 
disappointing for the most part. The housing market is universally 
acknowledged to be depressed, and will probably remain so until 
interest rates come down and the economy picks up, according to 
builders and brokers. Finally, reports from the agricultural sector 
indicate falling commodity prices, with farmland prices dropping 
too, as many farmers find it impossible to stay in business.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Retail Trade
          </strong>
          <br/>
          Most districts report weak consumer spending in early 
January, the result of a combination of factors. Many retailers feel 
that the strong sales experienced in the week before Christmas were 
basically borrowed from January sales. That is, consumers simply 
burned themselves out taking advantage of unusual pre-holiday 
markdowns, and simply have no money to spend now. Frigid weather has 
also played a part in holding sales down, with a large portion of 
the country held in the icy grip of one of the coldest winters on 
record. Finally, there is some feeling on the part of retail 
merchants that the flow of dollars into IRA accounts has also acted 
to take the wind out of the consumer's sails. (This is unlikely,
given the reports on IRAs. See FINANCE.) The softness in retail 
spending has led to an inventory buildup in some areas. Atlanta, 
Chicago, and St. Louis all report inventory accumulation. On the 
other hand, stock levels in Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas are 
reported to be in reasonable shape.
         </p>
         <p>
          Looking ahead, retailers around the country do not seem to expect 
much from the first half of 1982. Although contacts in Kansas City 
and Philadelphia are optimistic, they are exceptions. Most other 
districts say merchants expect the current sluggishness to continue 
at least through the first quarter, and possibly through the first 
half of the year.
         </p>
         <p>
          Auto sales are depressed nationwide. The recession has combined with 
high interest rates to give auto dealers their worst year in many. 
There is some hope for improvement though, should price reductions 
follow the General Motors-United Auto Workers negotiations. That 
might be good news for consumers, but, as noted by St. Louis, could 
put a squeeze on used car dealers if price cuts in that market 
follow.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Manufacturing
          </strong>
          <br/>
          Weakness in the manufacturing sector is widespread 
according to district reports, and industry still appears to be on a 
downtrend in many areas. While the softness spreads across many 
industries, a few seem to be particularly hard hit-automotive 
products, building materials, and steel. Inventory growth has led to 
production cutbacks, furloughs, and temporary plant closings in an 
effort to let accumulated stock run off. Just where the industrial 
sector is heading, and how long it will take to get there, is a 
matter of diverse opinion. Manufacturers in Philadelphia, New York, 
and Richmond seem to think that the trough is near. On the other 
hand, reports from St. Louis and Minneapolis point to further 
deterioration. Contacts that do see improvement in the situation 
don't expect it to come until at least the second quarter, and many 
expect it to be only slight at that.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Finance
          </strong>
          <br/>
          The year-end surge in business loan demand has held over 
into 1982 in most districts, but some bankers interpret that as a 
sign of weakness on the part of borrowers. Many firms are borrowing 
to finance unwanted inventory accumulation. Some cutbacks in credit 
extension may be anticipated, as banks are becoming more and more 
concerned with the creditworthiness of their customers. Consumer 
lending remains weak across the board.
         </p>
         <p>
          Deposit flows are mixed. S&amp;Ls continue to have trouble attracting 
money in most areas. The response to IRA plans has been sluggish in 
most districts, despite heavy promotion in some parts of the 
country, and banks that have experienced a strong demand for IRA 
deposits have often found very little new money going into them.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Real Estate and Construction
          </strong>
          <br/>
          The residential housing market is 
universally depressed, with the worst conditions indicated by 
Philadelphia, Richmond, San Francisco, and New York. Only houses in 
the highest price brackets are selling. A retightening of the 
mortgage market has held home loan rates in the 17 to 18 percent 
range and effectively choked off demand. Home prices are reported 
falling in several districts. Residential construction is at a 
virtual standstill in many districts, as homebuilders try to work 
off inventories.
         </p>
         <p>
          As for the future, reactions are mixed. While most real estate 
businesspeople agree that a large drop in mortgage rates will have 
to proceed any increase in demand, there is also some feeling that 
that alone won't be enough. Public confidence in the economy may 
have to be restored, through general economic improvement, before a 
housing recovery is seen.
         </p>
         <p>
          Commercial construction, while sluggish in some areas, is generally 
better than residential, and is even reported to be strong in 
Dallas.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Agriculture
          </strong>
          <br/>
          Weakness in agriculture rounds out the generally gloomy 
economic picture painted by this month's Redbook reports. Falling 
commodity prices combined with rising costs have put a squeeze on 
many farmers and placed them in a precarious financial position. 
Agriculture banks, concerned over the creditworthiness of many 
farmers at this time, have been monitoring borrowers closely and 
tightening policies on credit extension. The result has been 
foreclosures in some areas, and an increased number of farms on the 
market. Farmland markets are thus weak in many areas, with price 
declines noted by Chicago, Minneapolis, and Kansas City.
