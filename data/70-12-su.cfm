          Opinions expressed by bankers and businessmen in the twelve Federal 
Reserve Districts indicate that the more pessimistic economic 
outlook which had emerged last month was currently still in 
evidence, with some brighter 
spots—notably in residential housing—appearing here and there. Economic recovery was generally expected 
to be sluggish and more prolonged than had been anticipated earlier. 
Holiday retail sales so far were characterized as only fair to 
disappointing. Most manufacturers contacted reported unchanged or 
somewhat lower output and orders than last month, and in general 
looked for only a moderate pickup in the coming months. 
Concomitantly, there were further increases in unemployment in most 
Districts and additional reports of trimming of plant and equipment 
outlays. At the same time, it was generally felt that little or no 
progress was being achieved in curbing inflation, and sentiments for 
the adoption of an incomes policy or for other additional action by 
the Administration appeared to be growing.
         </p>
         <p align="left">
          A cautious consumer attitude remains in evidence. With the holiday 
season getting under way, sales have begun to pick up. Most 
retailers, however, look for business to be about the same as last 
year—in some instances worse and in others significantly better. 
Thus, reflecting the difficulties in the aerospace and timber 
industries, sales in the Seattle area were particularly depressed. 
Virtually all retailers contacted in the Boston District reported 
very disappointing Christmas sales, while in Philadelphia the 
physical volume of sales in large department stores were down 10 
percent from a year ago. On the other hand, retailers in some 
states—Colorado, Michigan, Wisconsin, Montana—look for a significant 
improvement over last year's holiday sales. As in previous months, 
"down grading", and "bargain hunting"remained in evidence, and 
higher priced items continued to perform poorly. Industrial 
production remains weak.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          Most manufacturers contacted reported no 
change or some decline as compared with last month in output, sales, 
and new orders and, in general, look for only a moderate pickup in 
the coming months. Further slowdowns were evident in the machine 
tools, electronic, and business equipment industries (notably in the 
Boston and Chicago Districts) and in the aerospace and timber 
industries (San Francisco), but the weakness also extended to other 
industries. Some rebound in December was expected in the Cleveland 
and Chicago Districts, which had been particularly hard hit by the 
General Motors strike. However, reports from the steel industry in 
the Cleveland District reveal that the release of steel stockpiled 
for General Motors has so far been smaller than expected. Moreover, 
those steel economists that were contacted felt that inventory 
stockpiling by steel users against the possibility of a strike in 
the steel industry next year would begin later than during previous 

strike-hedging periods, with the "big push" coming only late in the 
pre-strike period. The Minneapolis Bank's industrial expectation 
survey, for the first time in 13 surveys, showed a year-to-year 
decline in District manufacturing sales. On the other hand, 
considerable optimism was expressed in the Chicago District with 
respect to prospects for all major classes of consumer durable 
goods; capital goods producers in that District, however, were 
generally more apprehensive than a few months ago.
         </p>
         <p align="left">
          The slowdown in industrial production was reflected in a further 
weakening in the employment picture. Further layoffs and short time 
were evident in most Districts, with areas where particularly 
depressed industries—such as the aerospace, timber, machine tool, 
and certain nonferrous metal industries—loom large in the local 
economy being particularly hard hit. Unemployment among white collar 
workers and professionals continues to rise. For example, a 
professional engineering society in the Minneapolis District 
reported that 10 percent of the engineers in the Twin Cities were 
out of work. On the other hand, the rate of decline in employment 
was reported to be slowing down in the Richmond District, while 
reports from the Chicago Bank suggest little further change, with a 
rise in employment in consumer durable goods and construction 
industries offsetting potential layoffs in other sectors.
         </p>
         <p align="left">
          With respect to plant and equipment outlays, there was some evidence 
of further trimming or stretching-out of original plans. However, 
since manufacturers have now been cutting back on their original 
planned capital outlays for several months, the rate of reduction 
appears to be tapering off. On balance, the outlook is for little 
change in such outlays from current levels over the next six months.
         </p>
         <p align="left">
          One bright spot in the overall economic picture was provided by 
actual and prospective developments in residential construction, 
with most bankers and businessmen expecting a good to strong 
recovery in this sector.
         </p>
         <p align="left">
          On the price front, scattered price concessions by manufacturers 
were reported in some Districts. Further strong upward pressure on 
prices, however, was widely anticipated in the face of increased 
labor costs. In this context, several Districts reported that 
bankers and other businessmen feel the GM settlement will affect 
forthcoming labor negotiations. Durable goods producers in the 
Chicago District with negotiations still pending are expecting to be 
under great pressure to follow the GM pattern, while in the Atlanta 
District, the aluminum industry is reported to be fearful it may 
have to settle on similar terms.
         </p>
         <p align="left">
          The majority of respondents thus look for inadequate growth and 
inadequate moderation of inflation. Against this background, several 
Districts report growing sentiment for stronger action by the 
Administration. The Philadelphia Bank reports a feeling among 
directors and others than an incomes policy is worth trying, 
sentiment for wage and price controls was expressed by directors of 
the Atlanta bank, while a number of directors and others in the New 
York District felt the need for additional action by the 
Administration to solve the employment-inflation problem.
