            The rate of growth in business activity may have slowed recently 
  according to this month's District reports, but the trend continues 
  moderately upward. Consumer spending continues to increase; however, 
  demand for soft goods was reported to be weak in some of the 
  Districts. Inventories are generally being maintained at 
  satisfactory levels. Business loan demand remains relatively weak at 
  the larger centers, but some pickup in demand is reported by a few 
  Districts. Mortgage funds are ample at current interest rates. 
  Strong loan demand and high loan-to-deposit ratios were reported in 
  some of the agricultural communities. Residential construction 
  continues at a high rate and signs of rising industrial construction 
  were noted. Upward price pressures remain strong, particularly for 
  construction materials. Prospects are for a relatively large output 
  of farm commodities, lower average farm product prices, and little 
  growth in cash farm receipts from a year ago.

            Consumer spending generally continues up, but signs of weakness were 
  noted in some of the Districts. Apparel and soft goods sales were 
  reported to be weak by Chicago and St. Louis. Reduced sales were 
  reported in the rural communities by Minneapolis. Prior to an 
  upsurge in July, an overall trend toward slower retail sales growth 
  in the second quarter was reported by San Francisco. On the other 
  hand, sales of hardware, excluding automobiles, continued 
  persistently upward and a recent upturn in total retail sales was 
  reported by Philadelphia, Cleveland, and San Francisco. Automobile 
  sales were mixed with Dallas and San Francisco reporting continuing 
  strong sales while Cleveland and St. Louis reported some easing off 
  of such sales in July.

          <p align="left">
           <span class="content">
            Business inventories, with a few exceptions, are in satisfactory 
  condition. Continued shortages and delays in delivery are still 
  found in the construction industry. Chicago and St. Louis, for 
  example, reported some delivery lags for insulation, brick, drywall, 
  plumbing fixtures, lumber, and millwork. San Francisco reported that 
  automobile dealers are having difficulty in stocking all types of 
  cars. Somewhat fewer "shortages," however, were reported in 
  inventory items than heretofore, especially for raw materials used 
  in making tools and metal fixtures. Also a few inventory excesses 
  were reported. New York reported that mounting inventories are 
  becoming a problem for some businesses, and Cleveland reported that, 
  while inventories are not excessive, they are sufficient to dampen 
  further inventory growth this quarter.

           <span class="content">
            Manufacturing activity continued strongly upward according to most 
  District reports. Boston reported rising capital goods output and a 
  buildup in order backlogs. Further gains in the manufacturing sector 
  were reported by Philadelphia, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Kansas 
  City, Dallas, and San Francisco. Somewhat counter to the general 
  movement was the mixed situation reported by New York and some 
  leveling off by Richmond.

          <p align="left">
           <span class="content">
            Those Districts commenting on construction indicate a continuing up 
  trend in residential building and the beginning of a recovery in 
  commercial and industrial building. Construction of homes was 
  reported at virtual capacity by Chicago, strongly upward by St. 
  Louis, and strong by Minneapolis and Dallas. New York reports 
  tentative signs of a recovery in real estate and construction, and 
  San Francisco reported early indications of a pickup in 
  nonresidential construction.

           <span class="content">
            The comments on price expectations varied greatly from District to 
  District. However, the prices of construction materials appear to be 
  rising rapidly and prices for most farm products are declining. 
  Boston sees no escalation in the rate of price increases. Less 
  widespread price increases were reported by Richmond and a leveling 
  off of housing prices was reported by San Francisco. Lower farm 
  commodity prices were reported by a number of Districts. 
  Nevertheless, generally upward price pressures were reported by 
  Chicago, and sharply higher construction materials prices were 
  reported by St. Louis and Kansas City.

            The financial sector is characterized by relatively high demand for 
  consumer and farm loans, but sluggish demand for business loans. 
  High or rising demand for consumer loans was reported by 
  Philadelphia, Richmond, and San Francisco. Chicago, Minneapolis, and 
  Kansas City report farm loan demand to be exceptionally strong. 
  Strong real estate loan demand was reported by Richmond. While most 
  of the Districts report that business loan demand remains relatively 
  weak, there are indications that such demand is beginning to pick 
  up. Boston reported some rise in industrial loan demand. Richmond 
  noted some increased demand for loans by wholesalers and retailers. 
  Sluggish business loan demand in New York has prompted several banks 
  to seek out medium-sized regional borrowing customers. Some flew 
  York banks have already established out-of-state loan production 
  offices and others are contemplating similar action. Some moderation 
  in the rate of savings growth was indicated by reports from 
  Philadelphia, Cleveland, St. Louis, Minneapolis, and parts of the 
  Dallas District. Kansas City, however, reported strong deposit and 
  loan growth.

          <p align="left">
           <span class="content">
            No upsurge in interest rates is expected. Philadelphia reported that 
  the prime rate was expected to move up to about the 7-7-1/4 range 
  by the end of the year.
           </span>
          </p>
          <p align="left">
           Overall prospects for crop yields and production this year are 
  generally good. An abundance of grain and lower cost livestock feed 
  is in prospect for the year ahead. These developments point to 
  rising supplies of livestock products. Drought has had some adverse 
  impact on crop prospects in parts of the Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, 
  and San Francisco Districts, but recent rains have improved the 
  outlook for crops. Of great concern to the farm sector, however, is 
  the decline in prices of major farm commodities and the impact on 
  farm incomes. The generally unfavorable farm income outlook was 
  expressed by Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, 
  Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco. The lower farm commodity 
  prices, especially grains, are already having an unfavorable impact 
  on bank credit conditions in rural communities in a number of the 
  Districts. Chicago reported that deposit growth in agricultural area 
  banks has slowed, that loan demand is exceptionally strong, and 
  loan-to-deposit ratios are above desired levels. Kansas City 
  reported some serious farm cash flow problems.
