           Most districts report continuing growth in their regional economies. 
New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Chicago, and San 
Francisco all report further expansion over the past six weeks. Four 
districts—Atlanta, St. Louis, Kansas City, and Dallas—report 
slow or sluggish growth. Boston represents general business 
sentiment as cautious, and Minneapolis says business conditions have 
held steady.
          </p>
          <p>
           Though conditions in agriculture vary across districts, it now 
appears that, in the aggregate, the drought will have a much smaller 
impact on farm income than was originally thought. The slump in oil 
prices has depressed the energy industry in the Dallas district, but 
the effect has been minimal elsewhere. Construction of residential 
dwellings, especially multifamily structures, is slow and 
homebuilders are preparing for further declines; nonresidential 
construction, though, remains healthy. The manufacturing sector 
continues to expand, bolstered by a growing demand for exports. The 
outlook calls for caution and some easing in activity, however. 
Retail trade remains sluggish in most parts of the country, and 
store operators are anticipating only modest gains in the fourth 
quarter. In the financial sector, demand for consumer loans remains 
strong, led by home equity borrowing. Business lending is holding up 
as well.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Agriculture
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Agricultural conditions vary considerably by area. In the aggregate, 
however, it appears that the impact on farm income of any reduction 
in yield due to the drought will be largely offset by higher crop 
prices in general and federal aid to affected farmers in particular. 
And, while livestock producers' profits are being squeezed by rising 
feed costs, livestock prices are heading up as well, which will 
allow producers to pass on some of the increased costs. Kansas City 
reports that some cattle ranchers are maintaining herds through the 
winter in anticipation of higher prices in the spring. Feedlot 
operators, on the other hand, are seeing profits eaten away.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Mining and Energy
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Dallas reports significant weakness in oil and gas drilling and 
indicates that the rig count in the Eleventh District has dropped by 
14 percent since May. The slump has had little noticeable effect in 
other regions, however. While the rig count in the Atlanta District 
is down 7 percent from a year ago, operators of offshore 
installations say they would expand production if they could find 
qualified labor. In the San Francisco District, drillers are waiting 
to see if prices rebound before they change plans, and refiners and 
retailers are enjoying wider profit margins as a result of the drop 
in the wholesale price of oil.
          </p>
          <p>
           Minneapolis reports that gold-mining operations in Montana have 
expanded in the last year and that the stage may be set for 
expansion in copper mining as well. As a result, mine employment may 
be headed for its highest level in that district since 1983.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Construction
           </strong>
           <br/>
           All districts except Kansas City and Dallas report a slowing or 
weakening in residential construction and real estate; St. Louis and 
Atlanta note softening house prices as well. Overall, multifamily 
residential construction is weaker than single-family construction. 
Several districts indicate that homebuilders expect mortgage rates 
to head upward and are therefore bracing for further slowing. 
Nonresidential construction, however, remains healthy in most areas. 
Chicago specifically mentions public works projects as being strong.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Manufacturing
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Virtually every district indicates continuing strength or expansion 
in the industrial sector. Many cite rising exports as a primary 
source of demand for manufactured goods; Cleveland indicates that 
domestic production is displacing imports in some cases. The 
expansion in manufacturing spreads across a wide range of 
industries. Among the strongest are chemicals, paper and pulp, 
primary metals (specifically steel), fabricated metals, automobiles 
and trucks, electrical and electronic machinery, and nonelectrical 
machinery. Weaker industries include textiles and apparel, equipment 
related to oil and gas drilling, and defense-related operations.
          </p>
          <p>
           Despite the continued growth in manufacturing and the expansion of 
factory employment, wage pressures do not appear to be mounting at 
this time. Price movements vary by region and industry, but are 
generally moderate.
          </p>
          <p>
           Plans for increased capital spending by manufacturers are reported 
by several districts. In the New York District, major manufacturers 
of steel, automobiles, and electronic equipment have announced plans 
to establish new plants or enhance existing operations. Dallas 
indicates that chemical producers are straining capacity and are 
planning expansion. In the Philadelphia District, over 40 percent of 
the respondents to the monthly Business Outlook Survey say they plan 
to spend more on plant and equipment in the next six months.
          </p>
          <p>
           Despite the current boom in the sector, manufacturers are becoming 
less optimistic about coming months. Several districts say a slight 
slowdown became evident in late summer and that manufacturers, 
foreseeing a leveling off of activity through the first half of 
1989, have become very cautious. For the second month in a row, 
manufacturers in the Richmond District are anticipating a drop in 
business activity from current levels over the next six months.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Retail Trade
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Although several districts report a recent pickup in sales of 
general merchandise, retail business can accurately be described as 
weak or slow in most areas. Women's apparel is mentioned by several 
districts as a particularly weak line. Philadelphia says a slight 
pickup has occurred recently in higher priced merchandise.
          </p>
          <p>
           Despite continued sluggishness in sales, retail inventories at 
stores in most districts are at acceptable, lean levels thanks to 
strict monitoring and tight ordering policies. And, although sales 
remain low relative to plan, Boston, Philadelphia, and San Francisco 
all report difficulty in hiring qualified, in-store help and note 
some upward pressure on wages as a result.
          </p>
          <p>
           Retail prices are mixed. Boston reports that prices of lower-end 
merchandise are fairly stable, but that prices of higher-end items 
are rising fairly quickly. Minneapolis says price increases have 
been moderate and that some retailers in that region have switched 
to domestic suppliers as the prices of imported goods have gone up.
          </p>
          <p>
           Sales of cars and, especially, of trucks are reported to be strong 
in most districts. Cleveland reports slower sales stemming from a 
small inventory of 1988 leftovers and the reluctance of dealers to 
make price concessions to clear them out. In St. Louis, sales have 
leveled off after seven months of strong gains.
          </p>
          <p>
           The outlook for retail sales can be sunned up in one word: cautious. 
Store officials' forecasts for the fourth quarter range from 
"moderate" to "slightly improved." No one, however, is predicting a 
boom in holiday sales and most are likely to continue their policies 
of tight inventory management.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Finance
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Business loan volume is growing or stable in most districts, while 
consumer loam demand is generally described as strong. Mortgage 
lending, however, has tapered off. Home equity loans, on the other 
hand, are reported to be strong by New York and Richmond. 
Philadelphia notes that some bankers are concerned about funding the 
growth in loans and expect to have to raise interest rates on 
deposits to attract funds.
