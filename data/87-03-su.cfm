            March 16, 1987

           Assessments of general economic conditions ranged from uneven or 
steady to improving. Expanding activity or optimism were reported by 
contacts in the Boston, New York, Richmond, and Atlanta Districts. 
Cleveland reported slow expansion. Kansas City indicated recent 
slight Improvement. Chicago noted the effects of the mild winter in 
that District in boosting activity. Business conditions were 
described as on an even keel in Philadelphia, steady in Minneapolis, 
and uneven in San Francisco. Dallas noted signs of recovery but said 
important segments of the District remain weak.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Manufacturing
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Most reports noted rising orders and activity in manufacturing. 
Increases were described as gradual or small, overall, by Boston, 
Philadelphia, and Cleveland. Manufacturers in the Boston, 
Philadelphia, and Richmond Districts were optimistic about further 
expansion in manufacturing activity. Orders were described as still 
very sluggish by Dallas. More production cutbacks or plant closings 
were reported by New York, Cleveland, and Chicago. New foreign-owned 
auto assembly and parts plants are being built in the Midwest and 
Southeast. Capital spending was projected about flat by contacts in 
the Boston and Philadelphia Districts. San Francisco said many firms 
plan less capital investment in 1987 than in 1986. Chicago reports 
that demand for mechanical capital goods remains slow. Cost 
containment continues as a high priority. Several Districts noted 
upward pressures on prices. Higher orders were reported for 
appliances, products used in housing construction, some 
communications and computer equipment, medical equipment, plastics, 
chemicals, and paper, attributed in part to the lower dollar. Dallas 
reports that semiconductors have stabilized after 2 years of falling 
orders and frequent closings. Atlanta and Dallas report that demand 
remains weak from the construction and energy sectors.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Consumer Spending
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Most Districts report further growth of non-auto retail sales. 
Boston and New York said some retailers saw "astoundingly" or 
"unbelievably strong" sales in February. At the other extreme, 
retail sales were weak in the Dallas and San Francisco Districts. 
Kansas City said sales were flat to only slightly higher than a year 
earlier. Inventories were described as being at generally 
satisfactory levels, though some respondents told New York that 
stocks are low. Strength on the East Coast was attributed to the 
healthy regional economy and, in New York, to buying by foreigners 
whose currencies have strengthened against the dollar. Retail price 
increases, resulting in part from the lower dollar, are likely to be 
moderate. Tourism was described as good, except resort business 
curtailed by lack of snow in the Minneapolis District.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Motor Vehicles
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Most Districts report improvement in auto dealer sales in February 
or early March, from very low levels in January following tax-
related December strength. Dallas, however, saw little Improvement 
from the January pace in February, which was attributed to local 
economic weakness. Dealers there expect continued slow sales. 
Chicago reported auto production cuts and layoffs at some District 
plants, in response to slower sales. Demand for heavy trucks has 
improved.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Residential Construction
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Most Districts report strength in residential building. An exception 
is Dallas, burdened by a large stock of unsold homes and high rental 
vacancy rates. Housing markets in Alaska and parts of the 
Minneapolis District are also soft because of the weak energy 
sector. Home building permits have trended down recently in the 
Atlanta District, but builders there are optimistic. Chicago 
reported that residential building was boosted by mild winter 
weather, but Richmond said construction in that area was slowed by 
bad weather. Sizable home price increases were reported in some 
local markets on the East and West Coasts. Building material costs 
are expected to rise because of the Canadian duty on lumber exports.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Nonresidential Construction
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Office construction is slowing in most major cities, and office 
vacancies are high or rising. Chicago, however, reported that work 
on new buildings continues at a high level in that city. New York 
said that office leasing has increased. Chicago indicated that 
industrial construction had slowed in that region. Industrial space 
is in short supply in parts of northern New Jersey. Extensive work 
on military bases in upstate New York will be adding to construction 
activity in that region.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Energy and Mining
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Investment in the energy sector remains very weak, except for 
construction of natural gas pipelines noted by Atlanta. Dallas 
reports that the drilling rig count declined in February, seasonally 
adjusted, after rising since July. February's level was about half 
of a year earlier, and little or no increase is expected. 
Minneapolis reported a decline in coal production. Lack of demand 
for iron ore In that area has led to further layoffs.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Agriculture and Forestry
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Conditions in the farm sector appear to be stabilizing. Chicago 
reported that the decline in land values has slowed, farm earnings 
have improved, and agricultural debt repayments are faster. 
Minneapolis noted improved profits for livestock producers, but crop 
farmers remain dependent on the government for much of their income. 
Favorable prices for potatoes and beans have helped stabilize land 
prices in that area. St. Louis reported that farm incomes have 
stabilized. Dallas indicated that higher cotton prices are expected 
to help farmers in that District. Florida citrus growers have 
benefited from the lower dollar. Frost damaged the southern 
California avocado and citrus crops, and higher prices are expected 
for some fruits, vegetables, and nuts. Adverse weather delayed 
expansion of lumber production in the Atlanta District following 
imposition of the Canadian tax on lumber exports to the U.S. Demand 
for southern pine has remained strong.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Financial
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Several Districts reported continued strong growth of home equity 
loans. Philadelphia noted that a significant portion of usage of 
these lines was initially to pay down credit cards, but usage has 
shifted toward net increases in total debt. Some credit card issuers 
are tightening credit scrutiny in response to higher delinquency 
rates. New York attributes a slowdown in IRA deposits to confusion 
over the new tax law, low interest rates on IRA deposits, and 
restrictions on withdrawals.
