           <strong>
            August 18, 1971
           </strong>
          </p>
         </center>
         <p>
          According to the Reserve banks' reports, the economic recovery still 
appears to be proceeding quite slowly in most districts, with the 
industrial sector particularly sluggish. Strikes and strike-related 
effects have further dampened economic activity in some districts. 
The slow pace of the expansion has not yet generated renewed 
inventory accumulation. Retail sales are rising in some districts, 
but are slowing in others. The brightest spot continues to be 
residential construction. No improvement was noted in the employment 
situation. Prior to the President's imposition of the wage-price 
freeze, the bank reports indicated no slackening in the pace of 
inflation. In the financial sector, all the banks reported that
business loan demand was slack and that flows into consumer savings 
accounts had slowed noticeably. Only three banks included reports on 
the reactions in their districts to the President's new economic 
policies. Initial reactions were highly favorable.
         </p>
         <p>
          Durable goods manufacturing appears to be the most sluggish sector. 
The Boston, Richmond and Cleveland banks reported that new orders 
are weak in capital goods industries and backlogs are shrinking. The 
St. Louis bank noted that while orders are quite low for steel and 
durable goods manufacturers, nondurable goods producers are 
optimistic. A number of banks mentioned that suppliers to the 
construction industry were experiencing very good sales.
         </p>
         <p>
          The construction sector is reported except New York. Nonresidential 
building, as booming in all districts well as housing starts, was 
robust in a number of districts. The San Francisco bank reported 
that residential construction is providing the principal stimulus to 
the district's economy. Heavy construction activity was cited as a 
major reason for low unemployment in several areas within the 
Atlanta district.
         </p>
         <p>
          Half the banks reported that retail sales were rising in their 
districts. The San Francisco bank, however, noted that retail sales 
were only holding steady and the Atlanta bank reported that sales 
have moderated recently. In the New York district, retail sales 
varied from trendless to slowing.
         </p>
         <p>
          There does not appear to be any strengthening of inventory spending. 
The Richmond bank reported a substantial increase in the number of 
manufacturing firms decreasing inventories and that both trade and 
manufacturing inventories were still at higher than desired levels. 
Inventory cuts by industrial firms were also expected in the 
Cleveland district. Sluggish retail sales were cited by the San 
Francisco bank as restraining inventory investment. The St. Louis 
bank reported that steel producers expect steel inventories to be 
run down over the next six months, depressing their production 
levels. The Cleveland bank reported the beginning of coal 
stockpiling in anticipation of an October strike in the coal 
industry.
         </p>
         <p>
          Strikes and strike-related effects were depressing economic activity 
in several districts. Coal mining areas in the Richmond district 
have been hurt by the rail strike and the slowdown in the steel 
industry. The copper strike is reported to have affected economic 
activity in Maryland, Utah and Arizona. The San Francisco bank noted 
that the rail strikes especially hurt shipments of agricultural 
products, while the dock strike is affecting a widening number of 
industrial and agricultural producers in the twelfth district.
         </p>
         <p>
          No improvement in the employment situation was noted by any of the 
Reserve banks. The employment situation was described as unchanged 
by the Richmond, Dallas, and Chicago banks and as weak by the 
Minneapolis bank. The Chicago, Cleveland and New York banks reported 
high unemployment in steel producing areas, with layoffs continuing 
during early August.
         </p>
         <p>
          Continued inflation at recent rates was mentioned by a number of 
banks. The Atlanta and Dallas banks reported that retail prices were 
expected to continue increasing at recent rates. A survey of 
purchasing managers by the Kansas City bank (made before the 
President's August 15 speech) found concern about the near-term 
prospects for any slowing in the rate of inflation. In the 
Minneapolis and Cleveland districts, concern was reported over the 
inflationary effects of the steel settlement and announced steel 
price increases. The Minneapolis bank reported that a number of 
price and cost increases have already been instituted as a result of 
the steel price hikes.
         </p>
         <p>
          In the financial sector, the demand for business loans was generally 
reported as sluggish. The Richmond, San Francisco and Chicago banks, 
however, reported either good or improving demand for business loans 
in sections of their districts. Most banks also reported a 
considerable slowing in the growth of time and savings deposits. 
Fears of disintermediation were mentioned by the Kansas City, 
Chicago and Atlanta banks.
         </p>
         <p>
          Only a few banks contacted their respondents after the President's 
speech. Philadelphia reported that directors, bankers and 
businessmen in the third district, while surprised at the magnitude 
of the policy changes, were overwhelmingly in favor of them. 
Businessmen noted problems in implementing the wage-price freeze, 
but their general mood was one of cooperation and optimism. Initial 
reaction in the Chicago district among bankers and businessmen was 
also generally favorable. Only one bank director in the Boston 
district was available for comment. He was very enthusiastic about 
the new policies, although he noted some problems in implementation 
for banks. As a result of the President's speech, the Boston bank's 
academic respondents were generally encouraged by the prospects for 
breaking inflationary expectations and achieving a more stable 
international monetary system.
