           National Summary
          </h2>
          <p>
           <strong>
            December 4, 1996
           </strong>
          </p>
         </center>
         <p>
          Moderate economic growth continues to be

reported in nearly all Federal Reserve Districts.

Labor markets in most Districts remain tight,

although wages pressures are generally not

increasing except for some technical occupations

and skilled workers.  Retail prices are stable in

most Districts although some firming, mainly in

prices for materials and intermediate goods, is

noted by Richmond, Atlanta, Kansas City, and

Dallas.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Consumer Spending
          </strong>
          <br/>
          Retail sales have increased in most

Federal Reserve Districts.  Sales have moved up

in Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Minneapolis,

Kansas City, and Dallas in the past four to six

weeks, and San Francisco reported moderate

improvement in recent months.  Atlanta and St.

Louis have had year-over-year increases.  Chicago

reported that retail sales have been flat in the past

month but above last year?s level.  The only reports

of weaker sales come from Cleveland, where sales

were down compared to a year ago, and

Richmond, where sales have moderated in the

past month.
         </p>
         <p>
          By product line, apparel sales have been

relatively strongest in New York, Cleveland,

Atlanta, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and

Dallas.  Home products were also selling well in

Atlanta and St. Louis.  Electronic products were

selling strongly in Minneapolis and Kansas City

but poorly in New York, Cleveland, and Chicago.

Appliances were not selling as well as

other types of products in New York, Chicago, and

Minneapolis.
         </p>
         <p>
          All Districts that obtained information on

inventories reported that stocks were in line with

merchants? current or expected sales.  Price

discounting was increasing in Boston, New York,

Philadelphia, and Cleveland.
         </p>
         <p>
          Retailers? expectations for sales in the

upcoming holiday season are modestly optimistic.

In the Boston, New York, and Philadelphia

Districts, merchants forecast gains ranging from

2 to 6 percent, year-over-year.  Atlanta merchants

expect a slight increase.  In St. Louis, Kansas City,

Dallas, and San Francisco the season is expected

to be strong.
         </p>
         <p>
          Auto sales were mostly steady in Districts

that got reports from dealers.  In Philadelphia, St.

Louis, Kansas City, and San Francisco, sales were

roughly unchanged in recent weeks but at a high

level.  The sole negative report came from Dallas

where sales were characterized as sluggish.
         </p>
         <p>
          Tourism has been strong in the nation?s

coastal states.  Richmond, Atlanta, New York, and

San Francisco report high hotel occupancy rates.

Theme park attendance and bookings for winter

stays at coastal resorts have been high in Florida.

Minneapolis, however, reported  lackluster

tourism, although early snow has boosted

business in areas popular with skiers and

snowmobilers.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Manufacturing
          </strong>
          <br/>
          Nearly all Districts reported continued

expansion of manufacturing activity in October

and November. The improvement was generally

modest, although manufacturers in the Boston

District said they were seeing year-over-year

gains in orders and revenue of up to 15 percent.

Less positive conditions prevailed in the

Cleveland District, where production was just

steady, and in the Atlanta District, where "an

increasing number of factories are reporting

decreasing production and shipments."
         </p>
         <p>
          Boston noted strong orders for consumer

durables, furniture, appliances, computers, and

medical equipment.  Dallas and Atlanta reported

stronger demand for electronic products and

industrial equipment.  Boston and San Francisco

indicated that production of aircraft and related

equipment was moving up. Dallas noted strong

demand for energy equipment and oil machinery.

Some disruption in the production of autos and

related equipment because of strikes was reported

by New York, Cleveland, and Chicago; Cleveland

also noted that lost production was not scheduled

to be made up.
         </p>
         <p>
          Inventories were described as "normal" in

the Cleveland District and "satisfactory" in the

Kansas City District.  Inventories were declining

in Philadelphia.  Producers of electronic goods in

the Dallas District said their inventories were

high but coming down.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Real Estate and Construction
          </strong>
          <br/>
          All seven of the Districts reporting on

commercial real estate markets noted

improvement.  New York and Dallas indicated

continued improvement in office markets, and

Richmond and Atlanta noted increases in rental

rates and drops in vacancy rates.  Commercial

construction activity increased in the Districts of

Richmond, Atlanta, St. Louis, Minneapolis, and

Dallas.  Richmond and Atlanta received reports of

increased speculative construction of office

buildings.  Development of light industrial and

retail space was also under way in Atlanta and

Minneapolis.  Minneapolis reported robust public

infrastructure construction, and Dallas reported

strong construction of extended-stay hotels in that

city.
         </p>
         <p>
          Districts reporting on residential real

estate mainly observed slowing sales, although

sales levels remained high.  Richmond, Chicago,

Minneapolis, and Kansas City reported slower

sales.  In the San Francisco District sales fell back

somewhat in Arizona, Idaho, and Utah but

increased in Washington, Oregon, and the San

Francisco Bay area.  Home prices were steady in

Boston and New York, falling in Richmond, and

rising in St. Louis and the stronger markets in the

San Francisco District mentioned above.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Agriculture
          </strong>
          <br/>
          In general, Federal Reserve Districts that

surveyed agricultural conditions received good

reports.  Minneapolis noted that grain yields were

"excellent and better than had been expected

through the growing season."  St. Louis said that

"initial reports suggest that yields were generally

above average."  The soybean crop was plentiful in

the Cleveland and Dallas Districts.  Minneapolis

and Cleveland received positive reports on the

potato crop.  Other crops for which yields were

said to be good were rice, peanuts, and sugar beets.

Kansas City reported an excellent corn harvest,

but Cleveland said the corn harvest in Ohio was

about 20 percent below normal.  Minneapolis and

Kansas City reported that recently planted winter

wheat was in good condition in their Districts, but

Cleveland said seeding was hampered by muddy

field conditions.
         </p>
         <p>
          Dallas described livestock conditions as

"good overall," and Kansas City and Minneapolis

said higher cattle prices have led to an increase in

cattle at feedlots.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           National Resource Industries
          </strong>
          <br/>
          The current level of oil prices is prompting

high and growing oil-field activity.  Dallas noted

that "high prices continued to boost demand for oil

services," and Kansas City reported that the

District?s rig count rose 2.4 percent in October and

was above the year-ago level.  Minneapolis

reported that "iron ore mining and oil drilling

continue at the brisk pace that has prevailed for

several months."
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Financial Services and Credit
          </strong>
          <br/>
          Credit demand varied among Districts.

Only Cleveland and San Francisco indicated

growth in overall bank lending.  In other Districts,

lending was mixed.  Competition for new lending

was characterized as aggressive for business

loans in Philadelphia and St. Louis, for consumer

loans in Richmond, and in general in Cleveland.
         </p>
         <p>
          In New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland,

Atlanta, and San Francisco, banks reported

deterioration in credit quality, especially for

consumers.  Tightening of credit standards was

mentioned in New York, Philadelphia, Chicago,

St. Louis, and Kansas City.   No Districts reported

easing credit standards.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Employment and Wages
          </strong>
          <br/>
          Labor markets were characterized as tight

in a majority of Districts.  Districtwide labor

market tightness persisted in Richmond, Chicago,

Minneapolis, St. Louis, and Kansas City.  Atlanta

and Cleveland said labor markets were tight in

many parts of their Districts.  In most Districts

employers said skilled trades workers and

specialized technical workers were in particularly

short supply.  Boston reported that "demand for

highly skilled temporary workers continues to

outpace supply."  Richmond, Chicago, and San

Francisco also noted strong demand for skilled

construction workers.  Chicago and Minneapolis

said retailers were having difficulty hiring

temporary help for the holiday season.
         </p>
         <p>
          Reports from District banks do not

indicate a generalized acceleration in wage

increases despite growing reports of labor

shortages.  Cleveland, for example, said that its

contacts see "few signs of any significant rise" in

wages, and Atlanta said "reports of increasing

wages are infrequent in the region."  Minneapolis

reported that "many employers say there is no

generalized upward pressure on compensation."

Nonetheless, there appear to be more instances of

stepped up compensation, especially for highly

skilled technical workers.  Boston reports that in

the area around that city "compensation packages

to attract key technical employees are said to be

escalating rapidly."   Richmond contacts reported

more pronounced wage pressures in October than

in September.  A large temporary help agency

reported to Chicago that wages in the Midwest

were rising.  Also in the Midwest, Kansas City

noted "continued evidence of wage pressures,"

especially in manufacturing.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Prices
          </strong>
          <br/>
          District reports on prices suggest there

has been virtually no change in trend recently.

Boston contacts said "prices remain generally

stable."  New York indicated "there has been little

change in price pressures."  Cleveland and

Richmond characterized price increases as

 "modest."   Chicago reported that "price pressures

remained largely in check."   Minneapolis received

 "few reports of price increases for raw materials,

consumer goods, or services."   Most

manufacturers in Philadelphia and Cleveland

indicated that both input costs and output prices

were steady.  Manufacturers in Chicago said their

input costs were flat, and firms in St. Louis said

the cost of materials were  "stable to up somewhat."
         </p>
         <p>
          Exceptions to the relatively steady price

picture are petroleum products and fuels, whose

prices rebounded after falling in early November.

Also, there were more reports of rising industrial

prices in recent surveys in Richmond and Atlanta.

Kansas City observed rising costs of "some

manufacturing and construction materials,"  and

Dallas noted that "several industries reported a

general firming in prices."
