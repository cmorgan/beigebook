           Most District reports indicate somewhat stronger regional economic 
activity on balance in December and early January than at the time 
of the last reports in November, with much of the growth centered in 
the retail and industrial sectors. It would appear, on the basis of 
these reports, that the national economy gained momentum in recent 
weeks as consumer spending strengthened, manufacturing activity 
continued to rise, and producers scheduled more investment in plant 
and equipment.
          </p>
          <p>
           Reports on activity outside of the retail and industrial sectors 
were mixed and showed little change from the levels of recent 
months. In banking, loan demand was generally flat. In construction, 
commercial and residential activity evidently remained subdued in 
most of the country, although some areas of strength were reported. 
In agriculture, the continuing dry weather in some areas threatened 
the winter wheat crop.
          </p>
          <p>
           Although the overall tone of the District reports was upbeat, one 
District (Philadelphia) cited indications that the pace of activity 
may be slowing. Another (St. Louis) reported that growth was still 
sluggish even though conditions had improved in recent months.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Consumer Spending
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Eleven of twelve Districts reported on consumer activity. All eleven 
indicated that retail sales in December met or exceeded retailers' 
expectations. Three Districts also observed that the moderate-to-
strong pace of sales in December continued through early January. 
New cars sold well over this period, and truck sales were even 
stronger. Cleveland indicated that luxury goods such as electronic 
equipment and fine jewelry had sold especially well, which might 
indicate higher consumer confidence.
          </p>
          <p>
           Increases in retail prices were reported as moderate by Boston and 
Minneapolis, and Kansas City found prices to be generally steady to 
slightly higher. San Francisco observed that apparel prices were 
still rising faster than the prices of most other items. Boston 
reported that wages for retail clerks were still rising briskly.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Manufacturing and Mining
           </strong>
           <br/>
           All Districts reported on manufacturing activity, and most of the 
reports suggested that production levels were currently at or above 
November levels. San Francisco indicated expansion in the aerospace 
and electronics industries, and Boston noted strong demand for 
manufactured items used by the commercial aircraft and automobile 
industries and most capital goods industries. Dallas and Chicago 
noted increased demand for steel products, but Cleveland indicated a 
sharp slowdown in steel production, and reports from a few Districts 
stated that activity was down in some construction-related 
industries such as lumber.
          </p>
          <p>
           Several industries were reported to be operating at high capacity 
utilization rates, but only a few, such as chemicals, claimed 
capacity limits had constrained production. A majority of Districts 
indicated that manufacturers plan to increase capital expenditures 
in 1989 over 1988 levels. Mast of this spending will be for new 
equipment rather than plant expansion.
          </p>
          <p>
           Labor market conditions in the manufacturing sector appear to be 
about the same as in November in most Districts. Factory labor was 
reported to be scarce in some areas. Boston indicated that producers 
expect wages to rise this year at about the same rate as last year. 
Cleveland noted moderate increases in wages. Cleveland and Atlanta 
mentioned significant increases in employee benefit costs. About 60 
percent of the respondents to both the Philadelphia and Richmond 
surveys reported rising input prices. Boston indicated that the 
prices of some raw materials such as paper, wood, and most metals 
appeared to be stabilizing but that the prices of semi-finished 
goods such as petrochemicals were still rising.
          </p>
          <p>
           Reports on mining were mixed. Minneapolis and San Francisco 
indicated strong activity in silver and copper mining, and San 
Francisco also noted strength in gold and phosphate mining. But oil 
drilling activity in the Dallas, Kansas City, and San Francisco 
Districts was apparently restrained because of uncertainty about 
future prices.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Construction
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Reports on current nonresidential building activity varied widely 
across Districts, ranging from strong in Chicago and San Francisco 
to weak in St. Louis. Construction of industrial facilities was 
reported to be robust in some areas. Chicago indicated work on 
industrial buildings was very strong in the Midwest, and San 
Francisco mentioned new plants and continued expansion of 
manufacturing facilities in the West. Philadelphia, however, stated 
that despite a high demand for industrial space, "...construction of 
new industrial buildings may decline this year due to a pullback in 
lending to builders by financial institutions." Prospects for 
nonresidential building overall in 1989 appear to be relatively weak 
as new contracts declined in Chicago, Dallas, and St. Louis.
          </p>
          <p>
           In the residential sector, housing contracts and starts declined in 
the Chicago and Kansas City Districts, which suggested a future 
slowing of homebuilding activity in those regions. Dallas, however, 
indicated some growth in permits for single-family homes, and San 
Francisco reported healthy homebuilding activity in some parts of 
its District.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Agriculture and Forestry
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Six Districts commented on conditions in the agricultural sector and 
four of these—Richmond, St. Louis, Kansas City, and Dallas—
reported concern about the impact of continued dry weather. Dallas 
noted that the winter wheat crop had already been damaged by 
drought, and Kansas City and St. Louis said that dry conditions 
threatened the wheat crop in their Districts.
          </p>
          <p>
           Several Districts noted higher grain and livestock prices. While 
crop farmers have benefited, livestock farmers have been adversely 
affected to some extent because of higher feed costs. Kansas City 
noted that cattle operators in its District had not expanded herds, 
despite strong beef prices, because low moisture had reduced the use 
of winter wheat pastures for grazing.
          </p>
          <p>
           Reports of a slowdown in lumber production were recorded by Atlanta, 
Dallas, and San Francisco, but Minneapolis characterized lumber 
output in its District as strong. The softening in domestic demand 
for lumber, which was attributed to sluggish homebuilding, was 
reportedly offset somewhat by increased foreign demand.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Banking
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Loan demand varied among the Districts that reported or banking 
conditions. The demand for commercial and industrial loans was said 
to be weaker in the St. Louis District, largely unchanged in the 
Richmond and Kansas City Districts, and growing slowly in the 
Cleveland District. Philadelphia reported a strong increase in 
commercial and industrial loans so far in January, but a reduction 
in inquiries and applications. Both Philadelphia and Richmond 
indicated continued healthy demand for consumer credit, but 
Cleveland and St. Louis noted slower growth.
