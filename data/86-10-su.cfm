           Summary
          </strong>
          <br/>
          District Reserve Banks report overall economic growth ranging from 
relatively stable to slightly improved, with conditions varying 
considerably by region and economic sector. Strength in consumer 
spending is somewhat less evident than in last month's reports. 
While residential construction activity  remains relatively strong, 
reports of some weakening come from several regions. Manufacturing 
activity continues to be weak, with some specific exceptions. 
Prices, both at retail and for materials inputs, are generally 
reported to be steady. The serious slump in the energy industry 
continues, though some hints of modest improvement are reported. The 
depressed farm economy has been put under additional stress in some 
areas by drought and by heavy rains and floods. Loan activity at 
commercial banks is reported to be generally weak, with business 
lending relatively weak and real estate and consumer lending 
relatively strong.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Consumer Spending
          </strong>
          <br/>
          The general strength in retail sales reported in the last Beige Book 
is less evident in this month's reports. Improved retail sales, with 
gains in some instances greater than expected, were reported in half 
of the districts. The remaining six districts reported some recent 
weakening in sales (Boston, Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago), continued 
slow sales (Dallas), or sales growth slower than expected 
(Philadelphia). Where specific goods lines were mentioned, hard 
goods (especially appliances and home furnishings) were generally 
selling better than soft goods, though apparel sales were strong in 
several districts. Retailers in the Boston, New York, Chicago, and 
Richmond districts are optimistic about sales through the rest of 
the year, including  the Christmas season. Concern about Christmas 
season sales is expressed in the Philadelphia, Cleveland, and Dallas 
districts. Inventory levels are  generally viewed as ranging from 
slightly low to satisfactory. Retail prices are described as steady 
to "remarkably stable."
         </p>
         <p>
          Domestic new car sales responded strongly in all districts to 
national incentives, and 1986 model inventories have been generally 
worked off. Concern is expressed in some districts about an expected 
sharp deluxe in auto sales and about the effect of large monthly car 
payments on discretionary income and other consumer purchases.
         </p>
         <p>
          Foreign and domestic tourists have bolstered consumer spending in 
the  New York area. Tourism was up modestly in the Richmond 
district, but not as much as expected. In the Atlanta district, 
tourism remains strong but construction of many new lodging 
facilities has held down the benefits to individual hotels. Tourist 
traffic has been strong in the Pacific Northwest but disappointing 
in southern California.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Construction and Real Estate
          </strong>
          <br/>
          Residential construction activity remains relatively strong, but 
reports  of weakening come from several areas. The pace of 
homebuilding activity is reported to be vigorous by New York and 
Atlanta; New York reports no let-up in  sight but Atlanta expects 
some slowing soon. Housing activity in the Boston district remains 
strong, but is moving back towards normal after the fast pace of 
recent years. Residential construction is likely to continue at a 
high level in Chicago into 1987. Minneapolis reports strength in 
housing in Upper Michigan and North Dakota as well as in Minnesota. 
Residential construction activity is reported to be generally good 
in the San Francisco district, except in Idaho and Alaska. Both 
Cleveland and Richmond see a slowdown in housing activity, while 
both Kansas City and Dallas report a recent slippage in residential 
construction.
         </p>
         <p>
          Nonresidential real estate activity is reported as mixed. Commercial 
vacancy rates are rising in New England's urban centers but suburban 
shopping mall space is still in demand. Contacts in New York report 
some pick-up in commercial and industrial leasing. Commercial 
construction is weaker in the Richmond district, and Atlanta reports 
sizable concessions on office leasing. The vigorous pace of office 
and retail building in Chicago is expected to continue into 1987. 
Moderate expansion in nonresidential construction activity in the 
St. Louis district has been spurred by vigorous growth in Arkansas, 
Kentucky, and Missouri.
         </p>
         <p>
          Manufacturing activity continues to be generally weak, but with some 
exceptionsâ€”such as defense-dependent businesses in New England, 
and aerospace and related electronics businesses in the San 
Francisco district. This  generalization holds even though contacts 
report modest improvement in some areas and some industries, such as 
furniture and textiles and apparel in the Richmond and Atlanta 
districts. Capital spending continues to be weak, with  productivity 
enhancement a much more important factor than expansion. 
Manufacturing employment continues to contract, and prices of 
materials inputs are generally reported to be steady. The USX strike 
benefited other steel producers in both the Cleveland and the 
Chicago districts. Steel demand is reported good for autos, 
appliances, and construction uses; weak for equipment, railroads and 
shipbuilding. Automobile output has been falling persistently short 
of plans in recent months, and fourth quarter output plans have been 
reduced from earlier projections. Although light truck sales are 
setting records, medium and heavy truck sales have been steady to 
down.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Energy and Resources
          </strong>
          <br/>
          The serious slump in the energy industry continues despite somewhat 
firmer prices. Some slight stirrings are reported, however. While 
leading indicators of gas and oil drilling activity are still mixed, 
Atlanta, Dallas, and Kansas City report a very alight upturn in the 
drilling rig count. Chicago notes that while orders for steel for 
use in the oil and gas sector remain very low, they are up from zero 
earlier this year. Minneapolis reports a little activity in the oil 
and gas fields of North Dakota. Some improvement in the timber and 
forest products industry is reported by Atlanta, Minneapolis, and 
San Francisco.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Agriculture
          </strong>
          <br/>
          The farm economy remains depressed, and additional stress has been 
put on parts of the industry by drought and by heavy rains and 
floods. Grain crops, hay, and tobacco suffered from drought in the 
southeastern states, reducing cash receipts. Heavy rains and 
flooding in parts of the Chicago, St. Louis, and Kansas City 
districts delayed fall crop harvests, reduced yields, and also 
delayed winter wheat planting. But overall reductions from projected 
record yields of corn and soybeans are believed to be only modest. 
Government payments are expected to be a substantial support to 
grain, cotton, and rice farmers. San Francisco notes increased 
cotton exports, along with good fruit, potato, and bean crops in the 
northern states of its district. Livestock producers generally face 
a positive income outlook, due to strong meat prices and low feed 
costs.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Banking and Finance
          </strong>
          <br/>
          Total loan activity appears to be generally weak, with business 
lending typically reported as relatively weak and both real estate 
and consumer lending relatively strong. One exception is 
Philadelphia, which notes that demand for commercial and industrial 
loans remains strong. Philadelphia also says that banks are 
implementing more stringent credit qualifications for business 
borrowers. Atlanta notes a "more cautious lending atmosphere" for 
consumer loans, and St. Louis states that most district banks and 
thrift institutions have tightened lending policies for 
nonresidential real estate loans.
         </p>
         <p>
          Small and medium-sized banks in the New York district are coming 
under competitive pressure to lower lending rates. They are also 
lowering rates paid on variable rate accounts, and reluctantly 
beginning to look at "fixed rate" accounts. Some banks in the 
Richmond district have lowered passbook rates, but with a wary eye 
on the competition.
