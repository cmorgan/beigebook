           Reports on economic conditions point to modest improvement in most 
Federal Reserve districts, but the rate of gain is uneven. Ten of 
the 12 districts note a slight to moderate pickup in some or all 
sectors of the economy. By contrast, San Francisco indicates that 
weakness in California is offsetting moderate growth elsewhere in 
the district. Retail activity is reportedly increasing across most 
of the nation, and retailers are optimistic about the current 
holiday season. Manufacturing is improving in about half of the 
districts--generally, quite modestly. Ongoing cutbacks in defense 
remain a notable drag on the recovery in some regions. Residential 
real estate markets continue to pick up in most of the nation, but 
commercial real estate, where mentioned, remains weak. Loan demand 
reportedly increased in several districts, but credit conditions 
remain unchanged in others. The fall harvest is almost complete--
with record yields and output recorded in most crops.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Retail
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Retail sales in October and early November reportedly gained 
strength in all districts but San Francisco; results in that 
district were mixed, with California performing poorly relative to 
the other states. In five districts, sales in recent weeks were 
better than expected. Respondents in most districts noted greater 
consumer confidence. The Boston and Chicago reports link the change 
in consumer attitudes to the end of the Presidential campaign. New 
York retailers attribute modest increases to promotional efforts 
rather than to improvements in general economic conditions. Consumer 
confidence remains poor in southern California.
          </p>
          <p>
           Recent sales increases seem focused in nondurables. Apparel sales, 
in particular, were strong in New York, Cleveland, and Kansas City. 
Most districts reporting on auto sales found modest increases or 
slight declines, while sales of light trucks were strong in Chicago 
and Cleveland. In the three districts commenting on tourism, 
business was mixed.
          </p>
          <p>
           Despite increased sales, retailers across districts are satisfied 
with current inventory levels. While costs and prices are generally 
perceived as flat, reports from Boston, Cleveland, and Atlanta note 
less consumer insistence on discounts. Only Richmond sees increases 
in wholesale and retail prices.
          </p>
          <p>
           Except in California, retailers reportedly expect 1992 holiday sales 
gains to be better than last year's. However, the degree of optimism 
ranges from "the best performance in eight years" (in Chicago) to 
"nothing spectacular" (in New York).
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Manufacturing
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Recent manufacturing activity has been flat to slightly improved 
across much of the nation. Indicators from Dallas are generally 
strong, and Boston, Philadelphia, Cleveland, and Chicago report 
small gains, on average. Overall activity in the Richmond, Atlanta, 
St. Louis, and Minneapolis districts is described as "steady" or 
"unchanged," while many manufacturers in the New York district and 
California continue to experience weak demand.
          </p>
          <p>
           Demand for home building and furnishing products has strengthened 
among manufacturers located in the Boston, Richmond, Atlanta, 
Chicago, Minneapolis, and Dallas districts. But demand for autos, 
auto components, and other transportation equipment varies 
considerably across districts. For example, while Chicago district 
automakers report recent growth after a third-quarter sag, 
transportation equipment did not participate in the widespread rise 
in production reported for the Philadelphia district. Sales have 
improved for computer software and some hardware (Boston, Dallas, 
San Francisco), as well as for various nondurables (Atlanta, St. 
Louis, Dallas).
          </p>
          <p>
           The defense sector is an area of declining demand in the Boston, New 
York, Atlanta, St. Louis, and San Francisco districts. Although 
Kansas City notes positive export results, foreign sales are 
identified as an item of concern in the Boston, St. Louis, and 
Dallas districts.
          </p>
          <p>
           Little to no general inflationary pressure is reported. However, 
high capacity utilization rates have led or are expected to lead to 
firming prices for some construction materials and steel.
          </p>
          <p>
           Many districts continue to report employment reductions in 
manufacturing, although in some cases the rate of decline has abated 
and scattered hiring has occurred. Two-thirds of the Federal Reserve 
Banks note signs of positive or improved expectations about future 
business. Employment is not expected to increase in proportion to 
demand, however, as manufacturers across the nation are intent on 
cutting costs and improving labor productivity.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Construction and Real Estate
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Construction and real estate tell a tale of two markets, with 
improvements in the residential sector but continued stagnation on 
the commercial side. All districts report improved sales for 
existing and new single family homes, although Boston, New York and 
Richmond note doubts as to whether this improvement will be 
sustained. Home sales in the Dallas-Fort Worth area are at the 
highest level in five years. San Francisco reports that sales of 
existing homes in California rose in October, the first monthly 
increase since February. New York, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas 
City and Dallas all cite increases in single-family starts or 
permits in their districts.
          </p>
          <p>
           The commercial market, however, remains weak. Boston and Dallas 
report very sluggish conditions in commercial offices, while 
Richmond and New York have areas showing limited net absorption. 
Minneapolis finds a large excess supply of commercial property. In 
southern California, some rents have fallen 25 to 40 percent. San 
Francisco also cites forecasts that show California rents falling 
another 10 to 15 percent in 1993 and increased foreclosures. No 
district reports any growth in commercial construction, although 
Boston and Minneapolis report some public sector building.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Financial Services
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Financial institutions report a slight increase in overall loan 
demand despite a falloff in mortgage refinancings. A rising interest 
in business loans was noted by Philadelphia, Kansas City and St. 
Louis. Dallas and Atlanta report an increase in consumer loans. New 
York indicates that although residential mortgage activity continued 
strong, consumer loan demand weakened and demand for nonresidential 
mortgages remained soft. Demand for business loans is also weak in 
the San Francisco district. Boston reports that contacts among 
investment management companies experienced increases in assets 
under management.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Agriculture and Resource-Related Industries
           </strong>
           <br/>
           The fall harvest is over except for corn, which has been delayed by 
rain or snow in the Richmond and Midwest agricultural districts. 
Despite the wet weather, growers report record yields for corn as 
well as for the soybean, cotton, rice, and sugar beet crops 
harvested earlier. Abundant supplies have reduced feed prices and 
improved profits for dairy farmers, feedlot operators, and ranchers 
in the Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas districts. Thus, farmers 
in these areas continue to pay down debt. Nevertheless, according to 
contacts in Dallas, net farm income is likely to fall in 1992 
because of declines in prices and government subsidies and increases 
in production costs.
          </p>
          <p>
           As for lumber and wood products, strong demand from U.S. and foreign 
furniture makers has raised prices for hardwood from the Richmond 
district. Demand for western newsprint also remains strong, but 
restricted access to public timber supplies is noted as a problem in 
the Northwest. Several mills have closed recently because of a 
shortage of logs.
          </p>
          <p>
           Mining in the Minneapolis district continues slow; workers from the 
iron mines are on furlough, and oil and gas production and refining 
are generally unchanged. By contrast, contacts in the Kansas City 
and Dallas districts note a possibly temporary pickup in drilling, 
especially for natural gas. While oil and gas prices have drifted 
down, natural gas inventories are described as tight, and below-average temperatures could spur price increases.
