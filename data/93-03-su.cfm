           Reports from the twelve Federal Reserve districts indicated that 
economic growth continued in early 1993. Trends in economic activity 
seemed increasingly uniform by region, and although New England and 
California remained relatively weak, signs of growth were apparent 
in several sectors in each of these regions. Nationally, retail 
sales growth generally held up well in early 1993 after a strong 
holiday season, although inclement weather may have constrained 
sales in several districts during February. Reports from 
manufacturers generally indicated continued moderate expansion in 
activity, with production gains led by consumer durable goods and 
household items. Commercial and industrial loan demand remained flat 
or increased only modestly, however, with most districts reporting 
that loan growth was concentrated in consumer and home mortgage 
lending. Reports on employment gains were mixed, but still 
suggestive of some overall improvement in labor markets. Scattered 
price increases for basic materials were noted, and lumber price 
increases were widespread, but district reports continued to show 
little evidence of generalized upward pressure on prices.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Consumer Spending
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Retail sales growth held up well in most districts in January and 
early February, with contacts in several regions reporting better-
than-expected sales following a strong holiday season, although some 
contacts noted that adverse weather held back sales during February. 
Relative strength was reported in sales of durable goods, household 
items, or big-ticket items by retailers contacted in Cleveland, 
Richmond, Chicago, Minneapolis, and Dallas. Some department store 
contacts reported double-digit sales increases in St. Louis. In the 
Northeast, Boston noted some strengthening in sales after mixed 
results for the holiday season, and retailers in the New York 
district reported better-than-expected sales gains during January. 
Relative weakness was noted in parts of the Dallas and San Francisco 
districts, although one large retailer stated that conditions in 
California had improved somewhat. Atlanta reported some slowing in 
the pace of growth after a strong fourth quarter, and some retail 
contacts in Boston stated that sales gains slowed in late February. 
Bad weather reportedly impacted sales in February for retailers 
contacted by Philadelphia, Chicago, and Kansas City. At the same 
time, Richmond and Minneapolis both reported strong winter tourism 
seasons, and tourism was also a bright spot for contacts in Atlanta 
and Dallas. Several districts noted relatively low levels of 
discounting for this time of year, citing lean inventories in winter 
goods, and a good start for sales of spring merchandise was reported 
by retailers in the Philadelphia and Cleveland districts. Surveys 
conducted by several district banks found that retailers' 
expectations were generally optimistic, and planned inventory 
accumulation was underway in several cases, although ordering and 
inventory stances generally remained somewhat cautious.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Manufacturing
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Reports generally indicated continued moderate expansion in 
industrial activity, with signs of slowing in some markets balanced 
by accelerating momentum in others. Production growth was led by 
output of consumer durable goods, principally goods related to 
housing activity as well as motor vehicles and parts. Above-average 
gains in production of appliances, furniture and residential 
construction materials were reported by contacts in Boston, 
Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, and St. Louis. Robust sales gains in 
construction-related manufacturing industries were noted in Dallas. 
Production gains among auto parts manufacturers were cited by 
Boston, Atlanta, and Chicago. Several large domestic automakers 
contacted by Cleveland expected to meet March production schedules 
calling for output to rise 20 percent from a year ago. Contacts in 
several districts expressed concern about sales in Europe, but St. 
Louis stated that strong exports continued to bolster production for 
a number of manufacturers in the region, and each of the ports 
contacted in the Richmond district expected exports to pick up over 
the next six months. Relatively weak results were noted for firms 
producing energy exploration and production equipment, firms in the 
paper industry in the Minneapolis district, and aerospace and 
defense companies reporting in Boston, Cleveland, Atlanta, and San 
Francisco. At the same time, however. San Francisco noted that 
conditions were generally improving for other manufacturers in the 
region, with relative strength noted for manufacturers of computer 
equipment and software, capital goods, and biotechnology products. A 
broad majority of manufacturers surveyed in New York and 
Philadelphia expected stable or increasing activity, and 
Philadelphia also noted a pickup in the demand for industrial space. 
Broadening strength in output was indicated by the expectations of a 
group of capital goods producers surveyed in Cleveland, although 
Cleveland also noted a modest slowdown in growth in the relatively 
robust heavy-duty truck market. Sales gains reportedly rose among a 
wide majority of manufacturing contacts in the St. Louis district, 
with orders exceeding expectations for many firms.
          </p>

           <strong>
            Banking
           </strong>
           <br/>
           District reports indicated sluggish to modest growth in bank lending 
activity, with growth concentrated primarily in consumer and home 
mortgage lending. Surveys of bankers generally indicated flat to 
modestly stronger commercial and industrial loan demand. Banks 
surveyed by Kansas City and San Francisco reported that commercial 
and industrial loan demand was largely unchanged, while reports in 
Richmond, Atlanta, and Chicago indicated somewhat stronger increases 
in demand. However, Atlanta noted some disappointment among bankers 
in the pace of improvement. The Philadelphia, Cleveland, and Dallas 
districts reported some of the strongest gains in manufacturing 
activity in the nation, but reports from bankers surveyed by each of 
these districts indicated that commercial and industrial loan demand
was only flat to slightly increasing. Cleveland noted that potential 
borrowers were relying on strong internal cash flow or alternative 
sources of financing. Still, where surveyed, bankers' expectations 
for future growth in business lending were generally favorable. New 
York reported a sharp increase in the willingness of small and 
medium-sized banks to make some forms of business loans, although 
San Francisco observed that financing for small businesses remained 
tight. Consumer and mortgage lending was stronger than business 
lending across most regions, and most districts also noted renewed 
strengthening in home mortgage refinancing activity as well as new 
residential mortgage lending.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Real Estate/Construction
           </strong>
           <br/>
           District bank reports on new and existing home sales and residential 
construction were almost universally positive Underlying trends in 
housing activity remained relatively robust during a seasonally slow 
period for many areas, although inclement weather adversely impacted 
results in several regions. Declines in mortgage interest rates, 
increased buyer confidence, increased new home sales activity and/or 
lean inventories reportedly led to improved appraisals of market 
conditions by homebuilders in New York, Philadelphia, Atlanta, 
Kansas City and Dallas. San Francisco noted that sales activity 
increased in California, although prices remained soft. Residential 
construction activity was one of the strongest aspects of the report 
from the Minneapolis district. Weather difficulties were reported to 
have constrained activity in parts of the districts covered by 
Atlanta, Richmond, Kansas City, and San Francisco, although San 
Francisco also reported that housing starts an Arizona rose to their 
highest level in ten years. Most reports indicated little sign of 
improvement in commercial real estate markets, but reports of new 
deterioration were also thin, and Richmond noted an increase in 
activity and declining vacancy rates in both industrial and office 
markets.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Agriculture
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Reports on agricultural conditions were mixed but generally 
favorable. Increased rains and snowpack accumulation were aiding 
crop production in several regions, although St. Louis noted some 
concerns that substantial rainfall may have damaged the winter wheat 
crop, and flooding threatened the winter lettuce crop in Arizona. 
Crop prices were reported weak or below year-earlier levels in 
Richmond, St. Louis, and Minneapolis, with Richmond noting some 
concern about the potential impact on 1993 cash receipts. San 
Francisco reported favorable conditions for livestock producers, 
with good spring grazing expected. Higher beef prices were reported 
to have improved returns for ranchers and feeders in the Minneapolis 
district, although Kansas City noted that harsh winter weather 
slowed weight gains, increased death losses, and raised production 
costs for cattle feeders in that region. Still, bankers in the 
Kansas City region reported that farm borrowers generally remained 
in strong financial condition, with timely payments reported on 
agricultural loans.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Employment
           </strong>
           <br/>
           District batik reports on employment gains were mixed, but 
suggestive of some strengthening overall. Stable or increasing 
employment was more consistently noted in trade and service sectors 
than in manufacturing. A survey of retailers in the Boston district 
indicated little change in employment at existing locations, but 
about one-quarter of these firms reported plans to open new stores 
and hire new workers. Similarly, Cleveland reported that retail 
employment was following the normal layoff pattern after the holiday 
season, but expansion by several chains was expected to prompt 
hiring gains. Reports in the Richmond district indicated that retail 
employment was expected to improve over the next six mouths. 
Increased hiring by industrial firms was reported in some regions, 
helping to offset other reports of continued pressure on 
manufacturing employment. Significant layoffs in aerospace and 
defense-related industries were noted by San Francisco and Atlanta. 
Employment reportedly showed little sign of strengthening in 
Minneapolis, and layoffs proceeded at paper mills in that region. 
Producers were largely comfortable with current employment levels in 
the St. Louis area, but many of these contacts reported improved 
prospects for hiring Most of the manufacturing firms contacted by 
Philadelphia expected employment to remain flat, although roughly 
one-quarter of these firms expected hiring gains. Some manufacturing 
firms in the Cleveland, Chicago and St. Louis districts have been 
rehiring previously laid-off workers. Temporary help firms in 
Chicago and Dallas reported increased demand from manufacturing 
firms, and Dallas also stated that many manufacturers reported 
permanent employment gains. Several personnel supply companies 
contacted in the Chicago district reported increased permanent 
hiring of individuals previously working on a temporary basis.
