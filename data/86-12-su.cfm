          District Reserve Banks report economic conditions ranging from 
sluggish to generally good with more than half indicating some 
recent improvement. Strength in consumer spending is somewhat more 
widespread than in the last report, and most retailers anticipate a 
moderate to good holiday season. Residential construction continues 
at a healthy pace, but nonresidential construction has slowed as a 
result of oversupply. Manufacturing is still relatively weak, and 
some increase in input prices has been noted. While the energy 
sector remains depressed, an increase in the number of operating oil 
rigs has occurred. Farmers experienced near-record corn and soybean 
yields in some areas despite heavy rainfall, and livestock producers 
are benefitting from higher prices. Commercial bank loan activity 
has improved because of some upturn in business lending and strength 
in real estate and consumer lending. Many commercial banks are 
actively promoting the use of home equity lines of credit for 
consumers to retain interest deductibility under the new tax law.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Consumer Spending
          </strong>
          <br/>
          Most districts see an improvement in retail sales. Philadelphia 
states that sales were up strongly, and California and Richmond also 
had generally good gains. Sales were sluggish in Boston, Cleveland, 
Dallas and St. Louis, but the remaining districts report moderate 
increases. Items in strong demand were apparel, electronics, 
furniture, and other home furnishings. As a result of the recent 
improvement in sales, retailers for the most part anticipate a 
moderate to good holiday season. Inventories are at satisfactory or 
manageable levels. Prices (when mentioned) were generally reported 
as stable. However, Chicago attributed a jump in textile and apparel 
prices to recently imposed import restraints, and Dallas saw a 
significant increase in prices of imported electronics.
         </p>
         <p>
          All districts reporting on auto sales had strong gains in September 
and a sharp dropoff in October, mirroring the national pattern.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Construction and Real Estate
           <br/>
          </strong>
          Most districts report healthy residential construction activity, 
though at a somewhat slower pace than earlier this year. The 
Richmond district notes that home sales have been weakening due to 
the high level of home prices there. Atlanta reports a shift away 
from construction of multi-family units because of a high level of 
condominium inventories and generally poor demand. In contrast to 
most other areas, residential building in the Dallas district is 
substantially below a year earlier.
         </p>
         <p>
          Nonresidential construction has slowed in Atlanta, Dallas and parts 
of New York where an oversupply of office space now exists. In 
Chicago and Minneapolis, however, work on new office buildings 
continues at a steady pace. Reflecting higher demand for space, 
vacancy rates in the Minneapolis district fell between June and 
September for both office and industrial buildings.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Manufacturing
          </strong>
          <br/>
          Industrial activity remains relatively weak, and plans have recently 
been announced for additional plant closings and layoffs in several 
districts. The largest is the scheduled G.M. cutback, which will 
result in more than 20,000 job losses in the Chicago district and 
will affect other areas as well. Some industries and districts do 
report gains, however. The Philadelphia and Cleveland districts have 
seen an overall improvement in their manufacturing sectors in recent 
months. Both Boston and San Francisco state that the aerospace 
industry is doing well, and the USX strike continues to benefit 
competing steel producers in the Chicago and Cleveland areas. Many 
districts (Boston, Chicago, New York, Philadelphia. Cleveland, 
Kansas City and Dallas) mentioned an increase in input prices, which 
some attributed to the decline in the dollar. Most manufacturers are 
holding their own prices firm, however. Several districts reported 
no discernible benefit from the dollar's decline. San Francisco 
noted that increased exports of electronic products and higher 
capital goods orders have resulted from the weaker dollar.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Energy and Resources
          </strong>
          <br/>
          The stabilization of oil prices at a somewhat higher level led to an 
increased number of operating oil and gas drilling rigs. However, 
the total is less than half the number in operation a year ago in 
the oil-producing states. Chicago found that the oil and gas 
industry's demand for steel pipe is up somewhat from a recent very 
low level. The wood and forest products industries of Minneapolis 
and San Francisco have improved further. These districts also report 
an upturn and brighter outlook in copper mining.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Agriculture
          </strong>
          <br/>
          Despite heavy rainfall and flooding in many areas, farmers 
experienced record or near-record corn and soybean yields in the 
Cleveland, Kansas City, Minneapolis and St. Louis districts. 
Moreover, a feared storage crunch was alleviated by the rain-induced 
stretch-out of the harvest season. Attractive alternatives that 
encouraged farmers to redeem their PIK certificates and sell rather 
than store grain also helped avert excess stockpiling. Livestock 
producers and dairy farmers in several districts are benefitting 
from lower feed costs and from higher livestock and milk prices. The 
San Francisco district reports a record pistachio crop and higher 
potato and grape prices, while Florida expects an 8 percent increase 
in orange and grapefruit production over the year.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Financial Sector
          </strong>
          <br/>
          Loan activity improved somewhat in recent weeks. Philadelphia 
reports continued strength in commercial and industrial loans and an 
upturn in consumer loans, and Atlanta also states that lending has 
remained strong. Cleveland notes that loan demand rose slightly in 
all major categories, with real estate and consumer loans 
registering the greatest growth. A marginal increase in Cleveland's 
C&amp;I loans represents an improvement following no growth in the third 
quarter. St. Louis also reported strong real estate and consumer 
lending as well as some growth in commercial loans.
         </p>
         <p>
          Several districts noted that banks are promoting the use of home 
equity lines of credit as a means for consumers to retain some 
measure of interest deductibility under the new tax law. Atlanta 
reported that demand for home equity loans "has surged across the 
region", while Chicago, New York, Philadelphia, Richmond and St. 
Louis noted an expansion in banks' promotion of these credit lines.
