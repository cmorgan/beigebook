           Business activity has been increasing at a slow to moderate pace 
recently according to reports received in most Federal Reserve 
districts. More mixed reports on economic conditions were received 
in the New York and San Francisco districts, however. Consumer 
spending rose in a majority of districts, with particular strength 
noted in sales of autos and other durables. Tourism also displayed 
signs of strength in some districts. Manufacturing showed some 
improvement, with reports of inventory shortages in the auto sector. 
Residential real estate markets were generally stronger, and some 
pickup in commercial real estate markets was noted as well. Several 
districts continued to report weather-related crop damage, but 
conditions among livestock producers were generally favorable. 
Mining showed little overall change, but oil and gas exploration 
increased. Overall loan demand was steady to slightly improved in 
most reporting districts. On the price side, retail prices were 
described as flat or competitive, while price increases were noted 
for some building materials and manufacturing inputs.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Consumer Spending
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Retail sales registered gains in Cleveland, Dallas, Kansas City, 
Philadelphia and San Francisco, but were mixed or unchanged in other 
districts. Philadelphia noted that discount merchants made greater 
gains than others, and Boston retailers commented on the increase in 
competition resulting from the arrival of large discounters. Sales 
of appliances and furniture were strong in a number of districts, 
reflecting increases in home sales and remodeling. Response to the 
new fall apparel was mixed, however, with some areas reporting 
strong demand and others, sluggishness because of unseasonably warm 
weather. Auto sales were good in most of the districts. Some dealers 
reported that inventory shortages developed prior to the arrival of 
the 1994 models. The five districts reporting on the outlook for the 
holiday season stated that over-the-year retail sales growth is not 
expected to be as rapid as last year's strong Christmas season.
          </p>
          <p>
           For the tourist industry, results were generally favorable. In the 
Richmond district, hotels, motels and resorts indicated an 
improvement due to good weather and an increase in convention 
bookings, while Minneapolis reported that casino visitors and 
campers boosted spending in northern Michigan to a three-year high. 
Activity was mixed in the Atlanta district, however, stronger on the 
Gulf in response to new casinos, but down in southern Florida.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Manufacturing
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Manufacturing activity showed gains in most districts. In the Boston 
area, some contacts achieved double-digit year-to-year sales 
increases by introducing new products or expanding their customer 
base, and Philadelphia reported gains in new orders and shipments as 
well as increased hiring. Cleveland noted that domestic orders for 
capital goods appeared to be holding up well, with orders for some 
producers running store than 10 percent above a year ago. 
Manufacturing activity rose in Richmond and Chicago after a 
relatively flat period in preceding months, and Dallas reported a 
slow increase in demand and hiring. However, manufacturing activity
was more mixed in St. Louis, New York and San Francisco.
          </p>
          <p>
           The overall improvement in the manufacturing sector reflected 
increased demand in several industries, but some industries 
continued to have problems. A pickup in auto sales spurred output at 
auto producers and suppliers in several parts of the country, and 
construction-related products such as lumber, cement, brick and 
glass were also cited as in widespread demand. Electronics and paper 
producers added to payrolls in Dallas, and some gains in the 
semiconductor industry were noted in the Boston and Chicago 
districts. St. Louis stated that small businesses in particular 
showed strong growth recently, but that some larger firms were 
reorganizing and laying off. Aerospace and defense-related cutbacks 
continued in Arizona, California, Utah and Washington, and apparel 
plants in Mississippi and Georgia also were still paring back 
employment in response to sluggish retail sales and foreign 
competition.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Construction and Real Estate
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Most districts reported gains in the residential real estate market, 
with several citing sales of new and existing homes as a major 
source of strength in their economies. Among those districts where 
this sector was particularly strong (with home sales well above last 
year in most cases) were Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Dallas, 
Minneapolis and St. Louis. Atlanta noted that demand for new starter 
and mid-priced homes remained strong and that luxury home sales have 
improved as well, while Boston said sales were strongest in the 
areas previously hurt the most by the downturn. Falling inventories 
and rising home prices were noted in Kansas City and St. Louis. 
Dallas reported strong housing construction in its major cities with 
the exception of Houston, while Richmond said that starts in the 
district trended up. The residential real estate market was mixed in 
the San Francisco district, however, with strength in several states 
but softness in much of California. Starts showed little change in 
the New York district.
          </p>
          <p>
           Commercial real estate activity picked up and vacancy rates declined 
in New York and Richmond, while Atlanta saw signs of a revival in 
commercial construction. The market continued weak in downtown 
Minneapolis-St. Paul, but was strong in surrounding suburban areas.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Prices
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Minneapolis reported virtually no sign of inflationary pressures, 
and Atlanta found that wages and prices generally were stable. 
Boston and Cleveland noted that pricing remained competitive and in 
Kansas City, while manufacturers' input prices were rising somewhat, 
retail prices were generally holding steady. Lumber prices have been 
edging up in the Atlanta district, and Dallas reported that some 
other construction-related industries have also raised their selling 
prices.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Financial Institutions
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Overall loan demand at banks was reported as steady to slightly 
improved in most of the districts providing this information. 
Consumer borrowing has shown some signs of revival, while overall 
business borrowing remained slow. Mortgage financing and refinancing 
continued strong, and auto loans picked up in some areas. Kansas 
City and Philadelphia reported steady to somewhat stronger demand 
for other types of consumer loans as well. While business borrowing 
has remained soft in general, Philadelphia noted some improvement in 
demand from small and middle-sized business borrowers, and Cleveland 
also reported that commercial loan demand was up a bit. Bankers in 
Dallas noted that lending was slow, however. Loan volume in 
California was flat, although other states in the San Francisco 
district reported somewhat stronger demand.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Agriculture and Resource-Related Industries
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Large parts of the agriculture sector continued to suffer front 
weather-related problems, but not all the news from this sector was 
downbeat. Richmond reported that yields on most crops were far below 
average, despite some recent improvement in temperature and 
rainfall, and in the St. Louis district, Delta cotton farmers said 
yields were significantly reduced due to heat and insects. Severe 
drought conditions persisted in parts of the Atlanta area where crop 
yields were down substantially. It was estimated that corn, soybean 
and wheat production will be down 20-50 percent from normal in most 
of the Minnesota district, and grain quality was reportedly 
generally poor. Kansas City noted that corn and soybean crops were 
destroyed by flooding in low-lying areas and Chicago stated that 
flood-related losses appear greater than earlier estimates, 
especially for corn.
          </p>
          <p>
           On the positive side, cotton and peanut yields in Oklahoma and New 
Mexico were generally above normal, and the next winter wheat crop 
in the Kansas City district is reportedly off to a good start. The 
soybean harvest was progressing well in the Chicago area and 
Montana's wheat crop was 9 percent above the previous record. Due to 
the end of a prolonged drought, acreage was up on California 
farmlands, while Dallas reported that crop production was good in 
some parts (but suffering from too much moisture in others). 
Livestock production was reported to be stable or improved in 
several districts.
          </p>
          <p>
           Minneapolis stated that metal mining output was generally stable, 
with no change in copper output in recent months. Gold production 
there continued above year-earlier levels and mine expansions were 
reportedly under consideration. Drilling rig counts were higher in 
both the Minneapolis and Kansas City districts, while Dallas noted 
that offshore drilling in the Gulf of Mexico remained near capacity 
levels. Volume was down in the Pacific forestry industry, however, 
due to restrictions on public harvesting.
