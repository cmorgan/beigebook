           Most Federal Reserve Districts report sustained economic growth, but 
some note a somewhat slower pace of growth than earlier in the year. 
Manufacturing remains strong in most Districts, and export demand 
continues to grow. Retail sales have generally been somewhat 
sluggish recently, and construction and real estate activity have 
been mixed. In the resource sector a further pickup in oil drilling 
has occurred, but conditions in the forest product industry vary and 
the lack of rainfall is a concern in crop-growing regions. Several 
Districts report a recent increase in loan demand.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Consumer Spending
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Most Districts report that retail sales were sluggish during April 
and May due in part to the early Easter and unseasonable weather. 
Minneapolis and Richmond had favorable sales results, however, and 
Boston, Cleveland and San Francisco noted some improvement late in 
the period. Weakness in women's apparel was frequently mentioned and 
attributed to unpopular styles and resistance to higher prices. 
Despite the recent sluggishness of sales, retail inventories are 
generally at acceptable levels, primarily as a result of tight 
monitoring and generous markdowns on slow-moving items. Philadelphia 
described inventories as excessive, however, particularly at 
specialty stores. Views concerning the outlook are mixed. Those 
Districts with generally satisfactory sales anticipate more of the 
same, while those with weaker gains are less optimistic. For 
example, although some improvement occurred late in May, Cleveland 
department store executives believe the economy is in a consumer 
recession and expect no improvement before the fall.
          </p>
          <p>
           Atlanta reports that autos are selling well, while San Francisco has 
had strong sales of used cars but only moderate new car results. 
Cleveland and Kansas City found auto sales to be steady but not 
robust, while Dallas had mixed results.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Manufacturing
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Manufacturing activity remains strong in most Districts though 
Dallas and Atlanta report a slowing of new orders in some 
industries. Boston, Chicago, and Cleveland cite export demand as a 
factor in their manufacturing strength and Philadelphia notes that a 
year-long uptrend in manufacturing employment has continued. Chicago 
and Cleveland report sustained strength in the steel industry with 
Cleveland noting that the Great Lakes shipping industry is 
reportedly getting close to its cargo-handling capacity. San 
Francisco states that a number of industries are experiencing 
capacity constraints but that plans to expand are cautious. Several 
Districts mentioned rising input prices, particularly for paper, 
petrochemicals and steel, and Philadelphia reports an increase in 
factory wages resulting from a shortage of basic production workers. 
While Boston and Kansas City find that materials are still generally 
available, San Francisco reports shortages of raw materials, farm 
equipment and heavy machinery.
          </p>
          <p>
           Boston and Richmond report that factory inventories are at 
satisfactory levels, and Kansas City states that firms plan no 
inventory changes in the next six months. However, Atlanta notes, 
with new orders falling, textile producers find that their 
inventories are building. Most other manufacturers in Atlanta, and 
especially producers of paper and chemicals, remain strong. Factory 
employment levels are satisfactory or rising in Boston, Cleveland, 
Philadelphia and Richmond, but St. Louis reports that, except for 
transportation equipment, all major manufacturing sectors have 
reduced employment recently.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Construction and Real Estate
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Construction and real estate activity has varied among Districts. 
While residential construction is relatively strong in Chicago, 
Minneapolis, and Richmond, most other Districts report some 
weakening. Boston notes, however, that the prospect of rising 
interest rates may stimulate some activity in its currently slowing 
residential real estate market, and Kansas City states that most 
observers anticipate an increase in housing starts there. Commercial 
construction shows a more consistent pattern. Chicago and New York 
note a substantial amount of new office building underway and 
Atlanta and St. Louis report an expansion in nonresidential 
construction as well. Plans for several big projects have recently 
been announced in the Minneapolis District, and Dallas reports some 
recent stability in its nonresidential sector though at a low level 
of activity.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Agriculture and Natural Resources
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Districts reporting on agriculture present a mixed picture. The lack 
of rainfall is a concern in all of the crop-growing regions, but 
only Dallas and St. Louis spoke of reduced yields as a major threat 
thus far. Atlanta and Richmond have good crop conditions and 
Chicago, though noting a surge in crop prices as a result of the 
drought, states that the extent of irreversible crop damage is 
believed small at this time. Cattlemen in the San Francisco and 
Atlanta Districts are getting sharply higher prices and enjoying 
substantial income gains. However, livestock producers in Dallas and 
Richmond expect lower profit margins due to falling demand and 
increased feed costs.
          </p>
          <p>
           Oil production has stabilized in Atlanta and Kansas City and 
drilling activity in both Dallas and Kansas City is above year-
earlier levels. While Minneapolis describes a booming paper mill 
industry, Atlanta reports that prices for lumber and building 
products have declined, and San Francisco also notes some slowing in 
its forest products industry.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Financial Developments
           </strong>
           <br/>
           More than half the Districts mention an increase in loan demand. 
Philadelphia notes an acceleration in business loans and strong 
growth in real estate lending. An increase in real estate loans was 
also reported in the Atlanta, Cleveland, Kansas City and St. Louis 
Districts and Richmond, Kansas City and St. Louis note stronger 
demand for business loans as well. Dallas states that the rates of 
decline in assets and liabilities at its large banks have moderated. 
New York and San Francisco note that higher interest rates are 
causing a shift to adjustable rate mortgages.
