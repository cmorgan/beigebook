           National Summary

          <p class="content">
           <strong>
            March 20,  1986
           </strong>
          </p>
         </center>
         <p>
          Moderate economic expansion has continued in most regions of the 
country in recent weeks, despite unevenness across sectors. Recent 
improvements in economic activity are noted by New York, Cleveland, 
Kansas City, and Philadelphia. Richmond and Atlanta report sustained 
growth at a relatively strong pace, while Minneapolis and Boston 
indicate mixed conditions with no clear direction for the overall 
economy.
         </p>
         <p>
          The major sectors of strength included construction and selected 
manufacturing industries. Although industrial activity varied across 
Districts, general improvements were noted for energy-intensive 
manufacturers such as the lumber, paper, aluminum, and steel 
industries. Both commercial and residential construction continue 
strong in most Districts, with several reports noting benefits from 
falling mortgage interest rates. Major economic weaknesses continue 
to be concentrated in the agricultural and energy producing sectors, 
and further deterioration is anticipated because of continuing price 
declines, especially for oil. Consumer spending growth, although 
characterized as moderate, was noted in nearly all Districts.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Industry
          </strong>
          <br/>
          Industrial activity appears mixed, according to District reports. 
Solid improvement in manufacturers shipments and orders was reported 
by Cleveland in contrast to substantial declines earlier. 
Philadelphia reports continuing healthy increases in orders but 
little change in employment. Orders are improving for both the 
aluminum and steel industries, according to Cleveland and Chicago. 
Boston reports increased orders for manufacturing products related 
to housing, and signs of an upturn for the forest products industry 
are reported by San Francisco, Cleveland, and Richmond. In contrast, 
Minneapolis reports mill closings due to continuing Imports of 
forest products from Canada. The aerospace industry is prospering.
The steep drop in oil prices has stimulated energy-intensive 
industries, according to Atlanta. Although chemical firms have yet 
to benefit from lower prices for petroleum based inputs, producers 
are optimistic about the outlook. Richmond states that textile 
producers' workweeks are increasing and inventories are favorable.
         </p>
         <p>
          Other Districts continue to show declines in industrial activity. 
Large scale cutbacks in manufacturing employment were cited by New 
York, and staff reductions related to business mergers and cost 
containment programs are noted by Chicago. Manufacturers' 
inventories are reported to be tolerable, and there appears to be 
little upward pressures on prices.
         </p>
         <p>
          Minneapolis, Dallas, San Francisco, and Atlanta report further 
weakness in their recent declines in oil prices. Minneapolis reports 
rig counts in North Dakota at the lowest level in five years, and 
Dallas reports a 30 percent reduction from last year's depressed 
levels. In Alaska, where oil revenues contribute 85 percent of state 
revenues, the Governor has already taken steps to reduce state 
spending.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Consumer Spending
          </strong>
          <br/>
          There was widespread agreement among commentaries that consumer 
spending was up moderately in January-February from year-earlier 
figures. Consumer goods inventory levels across much of the country 
tended to be lean and under control. Boston reported that sales were 
somewhat volatile, in part because consumers are promotion-minded. 
"Cautious" consumer spending was reported by Chicago and New York, 
with the latter attributing it to uncertainty over the course of the 
economy. As usual early in the year, sales of nondurable goods 
tended to outpace durables. Dallas suggested that declining 
seasonally adjusted housing activity also contributed to relative 
weakness in durable goods sales there, and that sales in energy-
dominated regions were rising less than in other areas. Kansas City 
reported some unwanted inventory build-up at retail with slightly 
reduced prices as a consequence, while Boston noted that prices of 
imported goods are rising. The outlook for tourism in the Southeast 
has improved as a result of discount airfares, according to Atlanta.
         </p>
         <p>
          Auto sales are apparently showing varied temporal and geographical 
results. Atlanta's report of volatile activity, related to waves of 
limited-time cut-rate financing deals, was a typical commentary. 
However, Cleveland reported fairly strong and stable growth of 
sales, while Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco reported flat, 
disappointing, or declining auto sales.
         </p>
         <p>
          The dominant range of outlooks for overall consumer spending and for 
autos, particularly, seems to be moderate-to-bright. Philadelphia 
reported that retailers are raising their sales forecasts. 
Exceptions are those areas most adversely affected by declining 
energy prices, where spending growth prospects are considerably 
dimmed.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Construction
          </strong>
          <br/>
          Residential real estate markets are generally strong, and most 
Districts report some improvement in both sales and construction. 
The notable exceptions were in the Dallas District, where 
residential activity declined due to the uncertain regional economic 
outlook, and in the New York District, where cold weather, snow, and 
a labor shortage have slowed construction. Atlanta reports severe 
residential real estate weakness in Louisiana, which shares the 
energy sector problems of the Dallas District.
         </p>
         <p>
          Commercial construction also continues strong generally, although it 
is clearly weakening in the Dallas District. Atlanta noted a 
significant shift of commercial construction resources away from 
offices and stores toward light industrial buildings.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Financial Services
          </strong>
          <br/>
          Although reports vary among regions, the nation's total loans 
continued to increase in recent weeks. Dallas, Richmond, and 
Philadelphia indicate an increase in total loan growth, while 
Atlanta reports that the decline in growth in its region was checked 
for the first time in almost a year. New York, Philadelphia, and San 
Francisco reported that declining mortgage rates are sustaining 
mortgage volume and boosting the rate of refinancings. There are 
indications of declining or softening commercial lending at Dallas, 
Kansas City, and Atlanta and weaker consumer lending at Cleveland 
and St. Louis, the latter probably due to competition from auto 
dealer special financing packages.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Agriculture
          </strong>
          <br/>
          Most of the farm sector remains under heavy financial pressure 
resulting from large crop supplies and weak demand, which have 
continued to reduce market prices of most farm commodities. 
Depressed returns prevent heavily indebted borrowers from meeting 
scheduled loan payments, and farm foreclosure rates are rising 
principally throughout the areas of field crop production. Kansas 
City reports that from 6 to 10 percent of farm borrowers will be 
denied credit this spring. The Farmers Home Administration has 
mailed notices of potential foreclosure to 40 percent or more of 
their borrowers in several states in the Southeast. Minneapolis 
reports a banker's projection that one-third of indebted farmers in 
South Dakota will eventually leave farming. San Francisco relates 
that in addition to low prices and heavy import competition, some 
orchard producers suffered severe losses from recent flooding. On 
the brighter side, Richmond and Atlanta point out that poultry 
producers are doing relatively well with firm prices, expanding 
output, and falling feed costs contributing to growing profits. 
Conversely, Dallas indicates beef cattle feeders are stressed by 
depressed cattle prices and declining marketings.
