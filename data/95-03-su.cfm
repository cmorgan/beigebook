           Reports from the twelve Federal Reserve districts suggest that the 
pace of the economic expansion has moderated over the past two 
months. Half the districts note that growth has slowed, while the 
remaining districts generally report that conditions are mixed. 
Retail sales and residential construction weakened across much of 
the country. In contrast, manufacturing continued to grow in all but 
one of the regions and labor markets remained strong. Although 
commodity prices continued to rise, several districts note that the 
rate of increase has decelerated. There is little evidence that 
strength in labor markets or increases in commodity prices have 
spilled over into wages or prices of finished goods.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Retail
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Recent reports suggest that retail sales growth, measured on a year-
over-year basis, slowed in over two-thirds of the districts. 
Retailers in Boston report sales were flat or declining for a broad 
range of merchandise, including winter apparel, housewares, and 
sports equipment. Minneapolis cites news reports of a "retail 
slump," while retailers in both the Dallas and San Francisco regions 
report that sales declined along the Mexican border because of the 
weak peso. While two districts report noticeably stronger retail 
sales growth, they note that much of the strength is attributable to 
special factors--weather in New York and clearance promotions in 
Kansas City. Retail inventories have increased beyond planned levels 
in the Cleveland, Richmond, Chicago, and Dallas districts. Auto 
sales have generally weakened; dealers in the San Francisco region 
are using rebates and other incentives to bolster sales.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Manufacturing
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Growth in the manufacturing sector has generally remained strong 
since the beginning of the year. Manufacturing strengthened in 
Philadelphia, Minneapolis, and Dallas, while remaining robust in 
Cleveland, Chicago, and Kansas City. Sources in Minneapolis describe 
the strongest manufacturing performance in recent years. Boston, New 
York, Atlanta, and San Francisco report that conditions were mixed, 
with weakness in some segments of manufacturing offsetting strength 
in others. The sector continued to grow but at a slower pace in St. 
Louis. Preliminary results of Richmond's survey of manufacturers 
show that new orders, backlogs, and employment indexes were down 
slightly in February from their January levels. Contacts in three of 
the districts expect the pace of manufacturing growth to moderate in 
coming months.
          </p>
          <p>
           Capital goods industries have been particularly robust. Cleveland 
reports that orders of capital goods, led by strength in export 
markets, have continued to grow strongly. In St. Louis, exports of 
capital goods included construction equipment shipped to Japan in 
the wake of the Kobe earthquake. Computer equipment, pulp and paper 
products, and electronics are also repeatedly cited as sources of 
manufacturing strength. Examples of manufacturing weakness include 
the aerospace industry (Boston and San Francisco), automobiles and 
auto supplies (Boston and Chicago), and apparel (Atlanta and 
Dallas).
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Construction and Real Estate
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Construction of single-family homes continued to slow from 1994 
levels across much of the country. Atlanta, St. Louis, Kansas City, 
Dallas, and San Francisco report that homebuilding declined, while 
Philadelphia and Minneapolis report that activity leveled off. 
Looking forward, however, contacts in a third of the districts 
expect demand to strengthen later this spring. In contrast to the 
weakness in single-family homes, the construction of multifamily 
housing increased in both the Atlanta and Kansas City regions.
          </p>
          <p>
           Reports on commercial construction are more upbeat. Cleveland, 
Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis, and Dallas note an increase 
in commercial construction, driven by such diverse factors as a 
scarcity of large blocks of contiguous office space (Atlanta), 
expansion of manufacturing capacity (Chicago), and increased demand 
for warehouse space (Minneapolis). Reports on commercial real estate 
markets are mixed, however. The market softened for office space in 
midtown Manhattan. Philadelphia notes that its office market remains 
weak, although demand for industrial space has firmed. Within the 
San Francisco region, commercial real estate markets are weak in 
California but strong elsewhere.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Banking and Finance
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Loan demand was steady or higher in nearly all of the districts. The 
strength in lending was primarily attributable to commercial and 
industrial loans. In contrast, New York, Atlanta, St. Louis, and 
Kansas City report that residential mortgage lending slowed as the 
housing sector cooled; Cleveland notes that mortgage refinancing is 
at a standstill. Consumer lending--especially automobile loans--
weakened in Philadelphia, Cleveland, Atlanta, and St. Louis while 
remaining flat in Richmond and Dallas.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Agriculture
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Favorable weather conditions coupled with increases in crop and 
livestock prices brightened the outlook for farm incomes. Chicago 
reports that market conditions in the agricultural sector held up 
better than expected. Mild winter weather benefited livestock 
production in the Richmond and Minneapolis districts. St. Louis, 
Dallas, and San Francisco note that strong domestic demand coupled 
with reduced foreign supply boosted cotton prices.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Prices and Wages
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Although commodity prices have continued to rise, several districts 
report that the rate of increase seems to have eased. Boston notes 
that some suppliers of steel and chemicals are now offering customer 
rebates to soften the impact of price increases. Contacts in 
Cleveland report a moderation in the rate of increase of industrial 
commodity prices. Fewer manufacturers in Minneapolis report delivery 
delays, while manufacturers in Dallas expect price pressures to ease 
in coming months. In contrast, Chicago sees little evidence that 
manufacturers' input prices have ebbed and notes that recovery 
abroad may put upward pressure on commodity prices by tightening 
import supplies.
          </p>
          <p>
           In general, the districts report that increases in commodity prices 
have not spilled over into prices of finished goods. Boston notes 
that finished goods prices have generally remained stable, with 
increases for some products offset by decreases for others. Chicago, 
Kansas City, and Dallas report that intense competition among 
retailers kept prices flat despite increased input costs.
          </p>
          <p>
           Labor market conditions are generally strong. Cleveland, Chicago, 
and Minneapolis report that labor markets have remained tight. A 
survey by a large temporary help firm in Chicago showed further 
strengthening in employers' hiring plans after record high levels 
late last year. Similarly, Minneapolis notes shortages of skilled 
workers, particularly in manufacturing. New York, Atlanta, St. 
Louis, and Kansas City report spot shortages in labor. In contrast, 
manufacturers hiring for replacement purposes in the Boston region 
had little difficulty finding qualified workers. Despite the 
strength in labor markets, the districts report little evidence of 
upward pressure on wages.
