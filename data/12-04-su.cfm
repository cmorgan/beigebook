           April 11, 2012
          </strong>
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Prepared by the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland based on   information collected on or before April 2, 2012. This document summarizes   comments received from business and other contacts outside the Federal Reserve   and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials.
          </strong>
         </p>
         <p>
          Reports   from the twelve Federal Reserve Districts indicated that the economy continued   to expand at a modest to moderate pace from mid-February through late March.   Activity in the Boston, Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts   grew at a moderate pace, while Cleveland and St. Louis cited modest growth. New   York reported that economic growth picked up somewhat. Philadelphia and Richmond   cited improving business conditions. The economy in Minneapolis grew at a solid   pace and Kansas City's economy expanded at a faster pace.
         </p>
         <p>
          Manufacturing continued to expand in most Districts, with gains noted in   automotive and high-technology industries. Manufacturers in many Districts   expressed optimism about near-term growth prospects, but they are somewhat   concerned about rising petroleum prices. Demand for professional business   services showed modest to strong growth and freight volume was mainly higher.   Reports on retail spending were positive, with the unusually warm weather being   credited for boosting sales in several Districts. While the near-term outlook   for household spending was encouraging, contacts in several Districts expressed   concerns that rising gas prices could limit discretionary spending in the months   to come. New-vehicle sales were reported as strong or strengthening across much   of the United States. Tourism increased in most reporting Districts. Residential   real estate showed some improvement, with many contacts citing expansion in the   construction of multi-family housing. Activity in nonresidential real estate   increased or held steady in most Districts. Agricultural conditions were   generally favorable. Mining activity expanded and oil extraction rose, while   natural gas drilling slowed. Banking conditions were largely stable, with some   improvement seen in loan demand. Several Districts reported increased credit   quality.
         </p>
         <p>
          Hiring was steady or showed a modest increase across many Districts.   Difficulty finding qualified workers, especially for high-skilled positions, was   frequently reported. Upward pressure on wages was constrained. Overall price   inflation was modest. However, contacts in many Districts commented on rising   transportation costs due to higher fuel prices.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Manufacturing
          </strong>
          <br/>
          Manufacturing continued to expand in most   Districts, although respondents in the Boston and St. Louis Districts reported   that manufacturing was mixed and Chicago reported that growth in manufacturing   production leveled off after a strong start to the year. Contacts in automotive   industries reported gains in Cleveland, Atlanta, and Chicago. The Kansas City,   Dallas and San Francisco Districts reported increased sales for high-technology   manufacturers, with Dallas noting key demand drivers continue to be mobile   applications, cloud computing, and automobiles. The Philadelphia and Dallas   Districts indicated improvement in demand for manufacturing with ties to   residential housing and construction. Cleveland steel producers and service   centers reported that volume was trending slightly higher, while Chicago steel   producers said that capacity utilization was steady. For refiners in San   Francisco, capacity utilization rates continued to hold largely stable, as weak   domestic gasoline demand was offset by strong foreign demand for distillate   products. In Dallas, Gulf Coast refiners noted steady margins overall.
         </p>
         <p>
          Manufacturers in Boston, Cleveland, and Chicago are expanding payrolls but   finding it difficult to find highly-skilled workers. Comments from the   Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, and Kansas City Districts indicated a rise in   capital spending. Manufacturers in over half the Districts commented on   increasing input costs, focusing, in particular, on rising petroleum prices.   Contacts in Boston, Philadelphia, Chicago, Kansas City, and San Francisco   remained optimistic that activity will increase in the near term. However,   several respondents in Cleveland and Dallas noted that their outlooks have   become more cautious. Manufacturers in Boston and Cleveland expressed concern   about the European economy. Expectations were mixed in St. Louis.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Nonfinancial Services
          </strong>
          <br/>
          Demand for professional business   services was characterized as modest to strong in the Boston, Philadelphia,   Richmond, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts. St. Louis, Minneapolis, and San   Francisco reported that demand was mixed. Boston and Richmond cited rising   demand for advertising, marketing, and consulting services, while accounting   services saw a modest pickup in Minneapolis and Dallas. Growth in   technology-related services to the energy sector was noted in the Minneapolis   and Kansas City Districts. St. Louis and San Francisco reported that activity in   the healthcare sector was flat to down. Both Richmond and San Francisco noted   increased sales for restaurants and food-related service providers. Freight   transportation services were higher in the Cleveland, Richmond, and Kansas City   Districts. Reports from Atlanta and Dallas were mixed due to declining air cargo   volumes and railroad shipments. St. Louis reported that plans have been   announced to close certain freight transport and distribution facilities.   Contacts in Cleveland, Richmond, and Kansas City noted a shortage of qualified   truck drivers.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Consumer Spending and Tourism
          </strong>
          <br/>
          Retail spending continued   to improve in almost all Districts. Contacts in the Boston, New York, and St.   Louis Districts characterized retail activity as strong. Reports from Chicago   and Richmond indicated a significant strengthening in retail spending. Sales   expanded at a modest or moderate pace in Philadelphia, Minneapolis, Kansas City,   and Dallas. Unseasonably warm weather boosted sales in the Boston, Philadelphia,   Cleveland, Richmond, and Chicago Districts. Grocers in Cleveland and San   Francisco reported sales as unchanged. Apparel sales were strong in Boston and   New York. Purchases at home improvement stores were up in Richmond and Chicago.   Reports from Boston, Atlanta, St. Louis, and Kansas City indicate a positive   near-term outlook for retail spending; however, contacts in Philadelphia,   Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, and Kansas City expressed concerns that rising gas   prices could limit discretionary spending in the months to come.
         </p>
         <p>
          Automobile sales were reported as stronger or strengthening during late   February and early March in most Districts. Mild winter weather boosted sales in   Cleveland but depressed motor vehicle service spending in New York and   Minneapolis. Rising gas prices lead to increased purchases of fuel-efficient   vehicles in Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco. Contacts in Philadelphia and   Kansas City expect continued sales strength. Reports from Cleveland showed a   mixed outlook, with some respondents expecting solid sales and others seeing the   current pace of sales as unsustainable. Used-vehicle sales were reported as   strong or robust in Cleveland and San Francisco.
         </p>
         <p>
          Tourism was characterized as strong by respondents in the Boston, New York,   Richmond, and Atlanta Districts. Minneapolis indicated a slowdown in activity   due to a general lack of snow this winter. Conversely, warm weather boosted   tourism in Richmond. Bookings were strong in New York, and occupancy rates   improved in the Boston, New York, Atlanta, and San Francisco Districts. In   Boston and Kansas City, business travel continues to be the main driver of   tourism activity. Contacts in Boston and Atlanta expressed concern over high   fuel prices as a possible drag on leisure spending.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Real Estate and Construction
          </strong>
          <br/>
          Residential real estate   activity improved in most Districts, though Cleveland and San Francisco noted   that activity remained lackluster or at low levels. The St. Louis and   Minneapolis Districts reported increases in building permits. The construction   of multi-family housing units, including apartments and senior housing, expanded   in many Districts. Home prices continued to decline in Boston, New York, and   Minneapolis, but were largely flat in San Francisco. Contacts in Boston,   Philadelphia, and Kansas City indicated that mild weather had boosted real   estate activity.
         </p>
         <p>
          Non-residential construction activity improved in the Philadelphia,   Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, and St. Louis Districts, though many of   these contacts characterized the improvement as slow. Boston, New York, and San   Francisco characterized non-residential real estate activity as unchanged or   steady. The energy and high-tech sectors were driving much of the demand in the   Dallas District. San Francisco noted a rise in the demand for office space from   the technology sector. Cleveland and Chicago saw a boost in healthcare-related   construction. Projects related to the education sector are showing growth in   Boston, Cleveland, Philadelphia, and Richmond. The outlook of builders is   described as positive or slowly improving in the Philadelphia, Cleveland,   Atlanta, and Kansas City Districts, and as cautiously optimistic in Boston.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Banking and Finance
          </strong>
          <br/>
          For most Districts reporting on   financial services, banking conditions remained stable, with modest improvements   in demand for lending. Loan demand was reported as improved in New York,   Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Chicago, Kansas City, Dallas, and San   Francisco, while lending activity was unchanged in St Louis. The Dallas District   reported improved sentiment by national and regional banks due to improved   middle-market and large corporate lending. Contacts in Cleveland, Richmond, and   San Francisco reported that increased competition among lenders has been driving   more aggressive loan pricing. In general, the demand for commercial and   industrial loans remained steady, while several Districts reported an increase   in commercial real estate lending activity. The Philadelphia and Cleveland   Districts reported increased lending for multifamily housing and health care,   and contacts in Richmond cited increased lending to small business to finance   inventory and capital expenditures. Consumer lending has remained stable or   risen modestly across a few Districts. The Cleveland and Richmond Districts   reported increased home equity and auto lending, while bankers in Chicago noted   improved credit availability for auto loans and credit cards. Several Districts   reported that credit standards remain stable, but Richmond bankers reported that   they were offering easier terms to attract new commercial borrowers. Several   Districts reported increased credit quality, as delinquencies have continued to   decline and few problem loans have been reported.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Agriculture and Natural Resources
          </strong>
          <br/>
          Recent rain and   snowfall has helped alleviate dry agricultural conditions from earlier in the   year. Nonetheless, the Atlanta, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts   have all reported certain areas where drought conditions continue to persist.   Due to unseasonably warm weather, contacts in several Districts reported that   the planting of some crops is beginning earlier than normal, including corn in   Chicago and wheat in Minneapolis. San Francisco commented that there has been an   increase in certain input costs, such as fertilizer, while Chicago reported   tight supplies of some agricultural chemicals and corn seed. Atlanta and Chicago   reported an increase in the prices paid to farmers for soybeans; Chicago noted   that the increase was due to lower-than-expected harvests in South America.   Livestock prices rose in the Chicago, Minneapolis, and Kansas City Districts,   while orders for livestock were robust in San Francisco. Farmland values in   Kansas City continue to rise and are at record highs.
         </p>
         <p>
          Activity in natural resources remained strong. The Kansas City, Dallas, and   San Francisco Districts reported a shift from natural gas to oil exploration and   production due to low natural gas prices and growing demand for oil. In the   Cleveland District, leasing activity in the Utica shale is expanding. Cleveland   and St. Louis noted that the production of coal has slowed over the past few   months. The mining sector is expanding in San Francisco due to high prices for a   variety of precious metals, and iron ore mines in the Minneapolis District   continued to operate near capacity. Contacts in Kansas City reported a shortage   of engineers and experienced technical support for oil and gas drilling.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Employment, Wages, and Prices
          </strong>
          <br/>
          Hiring was steady or showed   a modest increase in the Boston, New York, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta,   Chicago, Minneapolis, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts. Industries reporting   some employment growth included manufacturing, freight transport, professional   business services, and information technology. A preference for part-time and   temporary workers was seen in the Richmond and Atlanta Districts. Atlanta noted   that temporary workers were being utilized in order to contain costs and retain   flexibility, while some employers in Richmond prefer temporary workers due to   uncertainty about future demand. Some employers in the Boston, Cleveland,   Atlanta, Chicago, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts reported having difficulty   finding qualified workers, especially for certain high-skilled positions.   Contacts in Philadelphia and Cleveland noted that new federal regulations are   exacerbating a truck-driver shortage. New York commented that employers are   planning to step up hiring activity in the months ahead. Boston, Richmond, and   Atlanta said that employers in their Districts are cautious and need to see more   robust growth before they expand their permanent payrolls further.
         </p>
         <p>
          Wage pressures were characterized as contained or modest among reporting   Districts. Contacts in Chicago, Dallas, and San Francisco noted some upward   pressure on wages for skilled jobs, especially in manufacturing and information   technology. In the Minneapolis District, strong oil-drilling and production   activity continued to bid up pay. Transportation contacts in Cleveland noted   some wage pressure due to a tightening of the driver pool. And medical benefits   continue to put pressure on labor costs in Philadelphia.
         </p>
         <p>
          Overall price inflation was modest in most Districts. However, contacts in   the Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts   cited rising transportation costs due to higher fuel prices. Minneapolis and   Dallas noted that airlines have raised their fares to offset higher fuel costs.   Richmond reported that rising fuel costs were a serious problem for both land   and ocean shippers, while intermodal transportation firms in Dallas said that   they had increased prices in response to higher fuel costs. In Atlanta, higher   transportation costs were passed through to consumers without much difficulty.   In contrast, contacts in Cleveland, Chicago, and San Francisco said it was   difficult to pass through higher costs to consumers. Input costs for   manufacturers in Boston, Cleveland, and Kansas City rose somewhat, but with   little pass-through. Price pressures have eased somewhat for manufacturing firms   in Philadelphia. Higher prices for construction materials narrowed profit   margins for contractors in Kansas City.
