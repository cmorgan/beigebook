           National Summary
          </h2>
          <p>
           <strong>
            March 13, 1996
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p align="left">
           Reports from the 12 Federal Reserve districts suggest the national 
economy grew modestly in January and February. Over half the 
districts cite moderate economic growth or continuing solid levels 
of economic activity. Most of the others mention recent 
improvements, largely reflecting rebounds from weather-related 
slowdowns earlier in the year.
          </p>
          <p align="left">
           <span class="content">
            Accounts of manufacturing activity are mixed. More than half the 
  districts report gains in at least some industries or sub-regions, 
  but Boston, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas suggest 
  production is either level or growing more slowly than in the last 
  report. Retail results generally improved in February, but in 
  several districts these improvements represent only a partial 
  recovery from weak sales during the holidays and January.

          <p align="left">
           <span class="content">
            Wage and price pressures are generally described as subdued, 
  notwithstanding observations of tight labor markets in several 
  districts. Wages are reported to be increasing at a modest pace. 
  Retail prices are rising only slightly if at all. Most commodity 
  prices are said to be steady, stabilizing, or increasing very 
  little; a few are falling.

            Retail
            <br/>
            Districts across the country report weak retail sales in January; 
  most, but not all, note an encouraging pick-up in February. Severe 
  winter weather contributed to January's slow pace, particularly on 
  the East Coast. February's uptick in sales was not seen in parts of 
  the west and mid-west, where the San Francisco, St. Louis, and 
  Minneapolis districts note continued sluggishness. Durable goods and 
  electronics are typically selling better than apparel, although some 
  respondents observe a rise in demand for selected clothing items, 
  contacts in New York and Chicago report the largest sales gains in 
  stores at the high end of the market.
           </span>
          </p>
          <p align="left">
           <span class="content">
            Retailers in a majority of districts are optimistic that sales will 
  pick up in the next few months. The outlook for those in the 
  Cleveland, San Francisco, Dallas, and Minneapolis districts is more 
  guarded. Upward movements in retail prices continue to be limited. 
  Reports from Boston, Atlanta, and St. Louis indicate vendor prices 
  generally remain stable.

           <span class="content">
            Auto dealers in the Philadelphia, Chicago, Cleveland, and Kansas 
  City districts report improved sales in February, following a 
  disappointing January. Dallas notes sluggish sales in both months, 
  leaving inventories larger than desired. contacts in the Chicago, 
  Cleveland, and Kansas city districts express more optimism about 
  this spring's auto sales than those in Dallas, Minneapolis, and 
  Philadelphia.

            Tourism
            <br/>
            Excellent skiing conditions on the East coast boosted tourism in the 
  Boston and Richmond districts. Atlanta reports strong tourism and 
  convention business, particularly in Florida, where northerners are 
  fleeing to escape harsher than usual winter weather. Minneapolis 
  notes a drop in tourism because of poor skiing conditions in 
  Montana, an unfavorable Canadian exchange rate, and the temporary 
  federal shutdown of South Dakota's national parks and monuments.

            Other Non-Financial Services
            <br/>
            In most districts surveying business services, demand accelerated in 
  February from a seasonal or weather-related lull in January; 
  elsewhere, services continued to expand at a good pace over both 
  months. Dallas notes gains in accounting and transportation while 
  San Francisco reports growing exports of high-tech services like 
  telecommunications, software, and financial consulting. The demand 
  for temporary workers picked up in Richmond, Chicago, and Dallas, 
  with Chicago noting ongoing labor shortages and Richmond reporting 
  that temporary workers' wages rose faster than the general price 
  level over the last year.

             Manufacturing
            </strong>
            <br/>
            Manufacturing activity has been mixed but fairly flat on average. 
  Several Federal Reserve Banks in the middle of the country 
  (Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas) report slightly slower sales 
  and orders, while the majority of districts to the east 
  (Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, and Atlanta) indicate a slight 
  strengthening since the latter part of 1995 or the beginning of 
  1996. Only the San Francisco report has a generally positive tone 
  for recent months, based largely on trends for machinery and 
  equipment.
           </span>
          </p>
          <p align="left">
           <span class="content">
            A number of districts report growing demand for capital goods, 
  notably industrial machinery, with Cleveland, Atlanta, and Chicago 
  citing a boost from exports. Sales of electronic and computer-
  related equipment appear to be rising, although Minneapolis reports 
  a slowing rate of growth for computer components, and Dallas notes a 
  drop-off in demand for memory chips and microprocessors. St. Louis 
  and Dallas indicate robust markets for cement. Auto-related and 
  apparel demand are widely reported to be sluggish, and paper mills 
  are experiencing declining sales according to contacts in several 
  districts.
           </span>
          </p>
          <p align="left">
           <span class="content">
            Manufacturers throughout the country report little or diminished 
  materials cost pressures. Paper prices in particular are falling, 
  and lumber prices are either falling or have ceased to rise. Several 
  districts note growing wage pressures or tight markets for some 
  categories of manufacturing workers. Overall wage inflation 
  reportedly remains moderate, however. Philadelphia and Richmond 
  report recent declines in finished goods prices, while most other 
  districts indicate little or no increase. Several districts 
  attribute the modest size of upward price movements to competitive 
  conditions in addition to the lack of cost pressures.

            <strong>
             Real Estate And Construction
            </strong>
            <br/>
            All districts report increased interest and activity in residential 
  real estate; most also report increased residential sales. Among 
  those with higher sales, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, 
  Kansas City, and Dallas indicate low-priced and subsidized houses 
  have done better than higher-priced homes. Upstate New York and 
  Philadelphia continue having excess inventories of housing stock. 
  Prices are said to be stable in most districts, but appear to be 
  showing some increase in the Kansas City (especially for low-priced 
  homes) and Richmond districts and in the San Francisco Bay area. 
  Richmond, Minneapolis, and Kansas City are seeing an increase in new 
  residential construction, and San Francisco notes increased 
  construction of apartment buildings in Arizona.

          <p align="left">
           <span class="content">
            Commercial real estate markets have also experienced increased 
  activity. New York, Philadelphia, Chicago, and Dallas report rising 
  demand for commercial space. Vacancy rates are said to have dropped 
  in the Philadelphia, Richmond, Atlanta, and San Francisco districts. 
  Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Minneapolis, Dallas, and San Francisco 
  report increased commercial construction in their districts.

          <p align="left">
           <span class="content">
            Contacts in all districts anticipate a strong and active spring 
  season. Despite some concern about interest rates and about 
  overbuilding in selected areas, respondents are optimistic about 
  both residential and commercial real estate activity during the 
  upcoming months.

             Financial Services

            <br/>
            Loan demand appears to be increasing in the majority of districts, 
  although it has eased in Cleveland and California. Most districts 
  indicate that demand for commercial loans has risen more than the 
  demand for consumer credit. contacts in New York, Atlanta, and 
  Cleveland report slightly higher loan delinquencies. Respondents in 
  all districts reporting on bank activity mention a surge in 
  refinancing activity.

             Agriculture and Natural Resources
            </strong>
            <br/>
            Arctic cold, drought, and fire have damaged the winter wheat crop 
  and pasturage in much of the St. Louis, Kansas City and Dallas 
  districts. In addition, in the Richmond district, parts of the 
  Pacific Northwest, and the eastern Dakotas, floods or heavy snows 
  have also hurt crops. With uncertain prospects for the 1996 harvest 
  and tight global inventories, grain prices are at their highest 
  levels in many years. While these conditions are benefiting grain 
  farmers in the parts of the Minneapolis and San Francisco districts 
  that have adequate moisture, ranchers are caught in a squeeze. With 
  the ratio of livestock prices to grain prices unusually low, the 
  Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas districts report declines in 
  ranch profits. In Minneapolis, bankers reportedly expect a rise in 
  ranch liquidations. Beef exports to Canada and Asia are helping to 
  support producers in the San Francisco district.

          <p align="left">
           <span class="content">
            In other natural resource industries, conditions are mixed. Iron 
  mines in the Minneapolis district shipped at the highest level in 
  over a decade, while output from nonferrous mines stayed stable. 
  Energy prices are reportedly volatile, with natural gas and fuel oil 
  prices fluctuating at high levels, while crude oil prices are 
  relatively weak. Dallas and Minneapolis report strong gas and oil 
  exploration activity, but in Kansas City and Dallas, the operating 
  rig count remains low.
