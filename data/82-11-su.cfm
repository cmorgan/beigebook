           Overview
          </strong>
          <br/>
          The economy is still entrenched in the recession, with 
District reports giving few indications of an imminent recovery. 
Lower interest rates and a slower rate of economic decline are cause 
for optimism, particularly in the North East, which has fared better 
than the rest of the country. Consumer spending, especially auto 
sales, remains weak in much of the country as consumers are cautious 
in the face of higher levels of unemployment. Manufacturing, mining 
and lumber industries are still experiencing widespread layoffs and 
plant closures, with no increase in orders to signal a recovery; 
defense-related industry remains strong. Lower mortgage rates are 
bringing optimism to the housing industry, but construction has yet 
to increase; commercial construction has turned down in many areas.
Low prices, weak demand and bad weather are keeping farm income 
down, with only livestock producers benefiting from low feed prices. 
Corporations and households are taking advantage of the recent drop 
in rates to restructure their balance sheets rather than buying new 
capital equipment or homes. Many fear that a rise in interest rates 
will stall any recovery next year.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Retail Sales
          </strong>
          <br/>
          Retail sales, especially sales of durables, remain 
weak throughout the country, and are being sustained in many areas 
only by promotional activity and aggressive pricing. Inventories, 
however, are now at acceptable levels. Retailers are optimistic 
about the holiday season in most Districts, but weak October sales 
are keeping some retailers cautious. In the North East and the St. 
Louis District, recent advances in retail sales are seen as 
encouraging. Auto sales, however, are still depressed, especially in 
the Atlanta District, where many dealers are failing. Lower interest 
rates are generating some optimism among dealers, but high prices 
and high unemployment continue to deter buyers. Despite the declines 
in interest rates, consumer lending has not increased significantly.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Manufacturing and Mining
          </strong>
          <br/>
          Though the view that the economy has hit 
bottom is widely expressed, signs of an imminent recovery remain 
scarce. Many of the Districts report further layoffs and plant 
closures, with expectations of more of the same, albeit at a slower 
pace. In the Chicago and Cleveland Districts, the capital goods 
industry is particularly distressed, with no upturn in new orders to 
signal a recovery. Low sales and imports continue to plague the auto 
and steel industries, and are now affecting truck manufacturers. 
Mining is down everywhere, and the lumber industry continues to 
experience very low demand, leading to further mill closures. Recent 
increases in drilling activity are attributed to tax motives, not to 
a recovery in the oil and gas industry.
         </p>
         <p>
          With widespread excess capacity, weak prices and pared inventories, 
some believe the conditions are now ripe for recovery. Others, 
however, are afraid that higher interest rates next year will 
continue to curtail economic activity and prolong the recession. 
There appears to be more economic strength in the North East than 
elsewhere, with the Boston, New York and Philadelphia Districts 
reporting strength in the business of their defense contractors, 
high technology manufacturers, finance and other service companies. 
Though some weakening in the high technology industry is evident 
there and in other Districts, defense-related business is expanding 
everywhere. One positive sign is the pervasive weakening of prices, 
which indicates continued low levels of inflation. It remains to be 
seen whether the moderating decline of business activity is indeed a 
precursor of the long-expected recovery.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Construction and Real Estate
          </strong>
          <br/>
          Lower mortgage rates have returned 
some life to the housing industry, with real estate agents, builders 
and lenders all reporting an increase in home-buyers' inquiries. 
Only in the Atlanta and Dallas Districts, however, is the 
improvement being translated into an increase in permits and 
construction. Elsewhere, the housing industry remains on hold till 
rates stabilize at this lower level and spring comes. Commercial 
construction is weakening, as there are few new projects to replace 
completed or canceled projects. Excess office space in the San 
Francisco District is expected to slow the construction of office 
buildings. while many Districts report cutbacks in plans for 
commercial construction, demand for construction loans is up in the 
Kansas City District, and commercial construction improved in the 
St. Louis District in October.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Agriculture
          </strong>
          <br/>
          Agricultural income continues to suffer from large 
stocks, weak domestic demand, poor export demand and bumper crops. 
Bad weather has caused problems in the San Francisco and Minneapolis 
Districts. Prices of many crops—such as cotton—are well below last 
year's. Cattle, hog, dairy and poultry producers are doing better 
because of lower feed costs. Low farm income is threatening some 
farmers with the loss of their farms, but widespread foreclosures 
are not expected. Values of farm land continue to fall. Lower 
interest rates will bring relief, but only in the future.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Financial Conditions
          </strong>
          <br/>
          The recent drop in interest rates has spurred 
a restructuring of corporate balance sheets. In the Minneapolis and 
Philadelphia Districts, for example, many firms have issued new 
equities and long-term debt to replace bank loans. Mortgage 
borrowers are also restructuring their debt, particularly in the San 
Francisco District where creative financing and balloon payment 
loans have created large demands for refinancing. Despite the length 
of this recession, delinquencies, foreclosures and problem loans do 
not appear to be causing unmanageable difficulties for most 
financial institutions.
         </p>
         <p>
          Depository institutions appear to be retaining a large proportion of 
the funds that were in all savers certificates, and some deposit 
gains have come from new types of accounts. Most institutions are 
preparing to offer the new money market account, but express concern 
about the likely increase in their cost of funds.
