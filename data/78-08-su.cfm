          National Summary
         </h2>
         <p align="center">
          <strong>
           August 9, 1978
          </strong>
         </p>
         <p align="left">
          Economic activity continues to advance, according to this month's 
  district comments. While there is concern in some areas that a 
  downturn may be in the offing, business activity generally appears 
  to be strong with little evidence of current weakness. Some 
  shortages of skilled labor and certain materials have developed, but 
  building activity and industrial production continue to post healthy 
  gains. At the same time, capital goods orders are strong, suggesting 
  that capital spending will expand further. Retail sales generally 
  remain robust, and inventories appear to be at moderate levels. 
  Furthermore, higher farm prices and good crop prospects have 
  improved the outlook for agricultural incomes. Demand for bank 
  credit appears to be strong and broadly based.
         </p>
         <p align="left">
          Moderate to strong gains in consumer spending were reported in most 
  districts, although Cleveland and Dallas experienced some recent 
  softening. Sales continued to be vigorous in most of the San 
  Francisco District, but some hesitancy was noted in California in 
  response to uncertainties about the impact of passage of Proposition 
  13. Automotive sales were strong in many areas of the country. 
  Nevertheless, sales were generally not expected to continue at the 
  current brisk pace. Richmond, for example, reports that at least 
  part of its strong auto loan demand reflects buying in anticipation 
  of higher prices.
         </p>
         <p align="left">
          Retail inventory levels generally appear to be in good balance with 
  overall sales, although some overstocking in a few lines was noted 
  by several districts. Major exceptions to this view were New York, 
  where several merchants expressed concern that stocks were higher 
  than desired, and Cleveland, where the level of inventories of a 
  wide range of merchandise is considered high. In general, retailers 
  appear to be optimistic about the near-term outlook for sales.
         </p>
         <p align="left">
          Among those districts reporting on building activity, most are 
  continuing to experience relatively high levels of residential 
  and/or nonresidential construction. Atlanta reports little or no 
  slowdown in housing starts or mortgage lending to date, and 
  nonresidential construction is also at a rapid pace. Housing 
  activity also remains high in the St. Louis and Cleveland districts 
  and in the latter, most lenders report no slowing in mortgage 
  commitments and loan applications. Dallas characterizes 
  nonresidential construction as the fastest growing sector in its 
  regional economy and notes that home building is also strong. Faced 
  with rapid growth, both Dallas and Minneapolis cite shortages of 
  cement as a constraint on their building activity. Nonresidential 
  construction remains high in San Francisco though home building has 
  slowed. A recent spurt in California residential permits reflects 
  the imposition of more costly energy regulations beginning in July 
  rather than a pickup in activity. Many of the districts reported 
  that the new six-month money market time certificate resulted in 
  better-than-expected deposit flows to thrift institutions. Chicago 
  and St. Louis note a leveling off of mortgage rates in their areas.
         </p>
         <p align="left">
          Industrial activity expanded in many areas during July. The volume 
  of new orders was strong in the Boston, Cleveland, Philadelphia, and 
  St. Louis Districts, while order backlogs have increased sharply for 
  transportation equipment in Chicago. A survey in the New England 
  area indicated that 80 percent of small businesses had higher 
  backlogs than a year earlier. Manufacturers responding in the 
  monthly Philadelphia and Richmond surveys also reported gains in 
  shipments and employment. Boston and Chicago report some industries 
  operating at or close to capacity. While inventories rose in the 
  Richmond District in contrast to a decline in Philadelphia, Richmond 
  manufacturers state that inventories more closely approximate 
  desired levels than in earlier months. Activity in the steel mills 
  of the Chicago and Cleveland Districts is reported to be robust. 
  Chicago steel producers are witnessing the best demand in four years 
  and orders in Cleveland have been strong due to automotive demand 
  and some stockpiling in anticipation of an August price hike.
         </p>
         <p align="left">
          The outlook for continued growth in capital expenditures appears 
  promising, judging from the reports of districts commenting on 
  capital spending. Cleveland expects good business fixed investment 
  ahead based on strong orders in its capital goods industry. At the 
  same time, producers of machine tools and other capital equipment in 
  some other districts report strong new orders. Nevertheless, there 
  were a few reports of continuing caution. For example, 
  Philadelphia's manufacturers expect to "hold the line" on such 
  spending.
         </p>
         <p align="left">
          Prospects for agricultural incomes in much of the country have 
  brightened considerably. Higher prices for livestock and crops, 
  along with a good harvest in view have raised farmers expectations. 
  Chicago contrasted the current farm situation to the dismal 
  conditions of last winter that prompted a strike. San Francisco says 
  its farmers are in the process of recouping the losses from the 
  heavy spring rains. As a result of the improved financial situation, 
  sales of farm equipment and farm spending in general have risen and 
  loan repayment problems have declined. However, as Kansas City 
  notes, continued reduction in beef production together with 
  liquidation of cattle inventory indicate even higher meat costs for 
  consumers in the months ahead.
         </p>
         <p align="left">
          Demand for bank credit was reported strong in most districts. The 
  source of recent demand appears to be broad based. Business loans 
  were strong in Philadelphia and St. Louis while Kansas City had 
  heavy demand for real estate loans and Dallas for real estate and 
  construction loans. Consumer borrowing was a major source of bank 
  loan demand in the Richmond and New York areas. Consumers in the 
  Chicago District also made liberal use of credit. So far, there is 
  no evidence of an increase in delinquency rates. Minneapolis and 
  Dallas were the only areas to mention the possibility of a liquidity 
  problem.
