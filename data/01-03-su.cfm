          A majority of Federal Reserve Districts reported 
                sluggish to modest economic growth in February, while others generally 
                reported mixed conditions. Growth was noted by Boston, New York, 
                Richmond, Atlanta, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco. Economic 
                conditions were mixed in Philadelphia, Cleveland, Chicago, and 
                Minneapolis, and St. Louis reported noticeably slower economic 
                activity.
         </p>
         <p align="left">
          Consumer spending rose slightly in most Districts 
                in January and February as retailers offered deep discounts on 
                winter merchandise. Auto sales were generally steady, but below 
                last year's rate. Manufacturing activity continued to decline 
                in most of the nation, although in the Boston and Richmond Districts 
                manufacturers reported improvement. Commercial real estate activity 
                eased in most of the Districts reporting on that sector, but vacancy 
                rates remain mostly steady and rents have been level or rising. 
                Home building activity rose somewhat in New York, Richmond, Atlanta, 
                Chicago, and Minneapolis, but declined in St. Louis, mainly because 
                of bad weather. Agricultural conditions in the Richmond and Dallas 
                Districts were adversely affected by dry weather. Low grain prices 
                and high costs for farm inputs have negatively affected farm finances 
                in the major agricultural regions of the country. Oil and gas 
                drilling have increased in response to higher prices, but mining 
                activity has been cut back in the wake of slackening demand for 
                mine output. Bank lending has been sluggish except for an increase 
                in home mortgage refinancing. Banks in some regions across the 
                country have tightened credit standards.
         </p>
         <p align="left">
          Although labor markets remain tight, over half of 
                the Federal Reserve Districts--Boston, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, 
                Minneapolis, Kansas City, and San Francisco--noted some signs 
                of easing. Demand for manufacturing workers has been declining, 
                and recently, demand for construction workers and information 
                technology workers has softened. Demand remains strong for clerical 
                workers in a variety of industries and for health care workers. 
                Employers reported some easing in wage pressures, but they have 
                seen increases in health benefit costs. Higher prices for energy, 
                especially natural gas, were noted in nearly all Districts, but 
                price pressures for many other products do not appear to have 
                increased.
         </p>

          <strong>
           Consumer Spending
          </strong>
          <br/>
          Retail sales rose modestly in a majority of Federal Reserve Districts 
                in January and February compared with the same months last year. 
                Increased sales of general merchandise were noted by New York, 
                Philadelphia, Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis, Dallas, and San Francisco. 
                Decreased sales were reported by Boston, Cleveland, Richmond, 
                and Kansas City. Many District Banks noted that the sales gains 
                were driven by extensive discounting in January to clear out winter 
                merchandise. Sales varied among major lines of merchandise. Women's 
                apparel sold well in New York, Cleveland, and Atlanta, but these 
                same Districts and Kansas City indicated softness in sales of 
                men's apparel. Cleveland reported increased sales of electronic 
                items, and New York reported increased sales of home furnishings. 
                In contrast, sales of home furnishings and housewares declined 
                in Cleveland and Kansas City. Sales decreased for appliances in 
                Chicago and jewelry in Atlanta.
         </p>
         <p align="left">
          Auto sales generally declined in the first two months 
                of this year compared with last year, although several Districts 
                reported that sales have improved from December. Auto dealers' 
                inventories were described as high throughout the nation, and 
                manufacturers were extending incentives to boost sales.
         </p>
         <p align="left">
          Tourism activity has held up in most of the Districts 
                that reported on this sector. Richmond indicated that business 
                was strong at ski and shore resorts. Atlanta reported increased 
                occupancy rates at hotels in Florida as did San Francisco for 
                hotels in California and Hawaii. Minneapolis reported solid winter 
                tourism activity. However, Boston reported unexpectedly weak growth 
                in tourism in New England.

          <strong>
           Manufacturing
          </strong>
          <br/>
          Manufacturing activity decreased in the first two months of the 
                year in all Districts except Boston and Richmond, where it rose 
                modestly, and New York and San Francisco, where conditions varied 
                among manufacturers. Falling output among makers of high-tech 
                equipment and motor vehicles and parts was reported by Atlanta, 
                Chicago, St. Louis, and Dallas. Declining output for electronic 
                products and telecommunications equipment was reported by Minneapolis 
                and Dallas. Production of industrial equipment and building materials 
                was falling, according to reports from Philadelphia, Chicago, 
                and Minneapolis. Some improvement was noted among manufacturers 
                of pharmaceuticals and biotechnology in the Boston and San Francisco 
                Districts. Philadelphia and San Francisco noted gains among manufacturers 
                of food products. Atlanta reported that shipyards in the District 
                had received increased orders for both military and civilian vessels.
         </p>
         <p align="left">
          Several Reserve Banks reported high inventories 
                among the manufacturers in their Districts. Cleveland and Chicago 
                noted excess inventories of steel. Dallas and San Francisco reported 
                high inventories of telecommunications equipment. Kansas City 
                indicated that inventories were above plan for most manufacturers 
                in the District. Manufacturing firms were reported to be trimming 
                capital spending in Boston, Philadelphia, Kansas City, and San 
                Francisco.
         </p>

          <strong>
           Real Estate and Construction
          </strong>
          <br/>
          Commercial construction activity eased in most of the Districts 
                that reported on this sector. Declining commercial contracting 
                was noted by Cleveland, Atlanta, St. Louis, and Kansas City; however, 
                New York reported an increase, and public construction was up 
                in the Cleveland and Chicago Districts. Commercial vacancy rates 
                were generally reported to be steady, although Atlanta and Chicago 
                noted some increases. More space has become available for sublet 
                as Internet and high-tech firms have closed or reduced operations. 
                Reports of such availability came from Boston, New York, Philadelphia, 
                Kansas City, and San Francisco. Nevertheless, commercial rents 
                have been steady to rising in most of these districts.
         </p>
         <p align="left">
          Reports on residential construction were generally 
                positive. New York, Richmond, Atlanta, Minneapolis, and Dallas 
                reported increases in home building, although gains were modest. 
                Residential construction activity was steady in Philadelphia and 
                Kansas City and down in St. Louis. Adverse weather was blamed 
                for the slowdown in St. Louis.
         </p>
         <p align="left">
          Sales of new and existing homes continue to be fairly 
                brisk in many regions, bolstered by lower mortgage interest rates. 
                Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, and St. Louis reported stepped-up 
                home sales. Such sales were steady in the Philadelphia District, 
                and down in the Kansas City and San Francisco Districts. New York 
                and Philadelphia reported steady price appreciation for both new 
                and existing homes, but Atlanta noted some price concessions by 
                builders in its District.
         </p>

          <strong>
           Agriculture
          </strong>
          <br/>
          Rising costs for farm inputs have negatively affected farm finances. 
                Increased costs of fertilizers and pesticides were reported by 
                Chicago, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco. 
                Grain production in the Richmond District has been hurt by low 
                soil moisture levels. Dry conditions have also reduced pasturage 
                in the District. Agricultural production in the Dallas District 
                has also been impaired by dry weather, but recent rains have improved 
                prospects for the wheat crop and cattle forage. In general, grain 
                prices remain low, but cattle prices appear to be firming.

          <strong>
           Natural Resource Industries
          </strong>
          <br/>
          Higher prices for oil and natural gas have stimulated exploration 
                activity in the Minneapolis District and boosted the rig count 
                in the Kansas City and Dallas Districts. Drilling has been constrained 
                by limited availability of manpower and equipment, but Kansas 
                City reports that new equipment will soon be in service. In contrast 
                to oil and gas production, mining remains weak as low commodity 
                prices and high energy costs squeeze mine profitability. Minneapolis 
                reported recent and prospective reductions in output of lead, 
                aluminum, copper, and iron.

           Financial Services and Credit
          </strong>
          <br/>
          Bank lending, other than residential mortgage refinancing, was 
                lackluster in most Districts. Business loan demand eased in Atlanta, 
                Chicago, St. Louis, and Kansas City. Commercial banks in the San 
                Francisco District reported decreased demand for business loans 
                for capital spending and plant expansion and increased demand 
                for asset-based loans. New York, Philadelphia, and Cleveland indicated 
                that commercial and industrial loan demand in their Districts 
                has been steady. Philadelphia, Richmond, and San Francisco reported 
                that business loan demand has been restrained as firms in a variety 
                of industries have cancelled or postponed plans to expand their 
                operations. In particular, high-tech, telecommunication, and Internet 
                firms have scaled back their activities.
         </p>
         <p align="left">
          Consumer lending decreased in Philadelphia, Atlanta, 
                and St. Louis. Chicago noted an increase in credit card usage 
                and outstanding balances. Mortgage lending for home purchases 
                rose in New York and Chicago, fell in Philadelphia and Atlanta, 
                and was steady in Kansas City. As mortgage rates have fallen, 
                refinancing activity was reported to have picked up in New York, 
                Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, and Kansas City.
         </p>
         <p align="left">
          Commercial banks in several Districts have tightened 
                credit standards. New York, Richmond, Atlanta, St. Louis, Dallas, 
                and San Francisco noted that banks in those Districts had tightened 
                standards and stepped up monitoring of borrowers, especially for 
                business loans and commercial real estate loans. Banks in the 
                St. Louis District indicated that nonperforming loans have increased, 
                but banks in the Atlanta and Dallas Districts reported that loan 
                quality has been steady.
         </p>

           Employment and Wages
          </strong>
          <br/>
          Most Reserve Banks continue to describe labor markets in their 
                Districts as tight, but a number noted recent signs of easing. 
                Greater availability of workers was noted by Atlanta, Chicago, 
                St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco. 
                Demand for manufacturing workers fell in Cleveland, Kansas City, 
                Chicago, and Minneapolis. Hiring of construction workers eased 
                in Kansas City. Demand for information technology specialists 
                declined in Boston. Demand decreased for temporary workers in 
                a variety of industries in Boston and Chicago, although Richmond 
                reported that the market for temporary workers there was mixed. 
                Strong demand persists for clerical workers in many industries 
                in New York, Cleveland, and San Francisco. Atlanta, Minneapolis, 
                and Kansas City reported that nurses and other health care workers 
                remain in high demand.
         </p>
         <p align="left">
          Employers reported some easing of wage pressures 
                in Boston, New York, Minneapolis, and Kansas City. Employers in 
                San Francisco have reduced or eliminated signing bonuses. Despite 
                easing wage pressures, employee benefit costs, especially for 
                health insurance, continue to rise. New York, Atlanta, Minneapolis, 
                and San Francisco indicated that businesses in their Districts 
                are facing large increases.

          <strong>
           Prices
          </strong>
          <br/>
          Several Reserve Banks noted lower retail prices during January 
                as stores offered deep discounts to sell winter goods. In February, 
                retail prices were more stable. Nearly all Districts reported 
                higher energy and natural gas prices. In most Districts, firms 
                indicated that they have not passed higher fuel and energy costs 
                on to their customers, but businesses in the Dallas and San Francisco 
                Districts have been raising prices or imposing surcharges to cover 
                the additional costs. According to reports received by Reserve 
                Banks, price pressures have not increased for most products other
