           <strong>
            January 21, 1993

          Reports from the twelve Federal Reserve districts indicate continued 
  improvement in economic conditions across much of the nation. 
  Conditions are mixed, however, in the San Francisco district where 
  weakness in California continues to offset moderate growth in other 
  district states. Retail sales during the holiday season were 
  significantly better than a year earlier in most districts, 
  generally fulfilling or exceeding retailers' expectations. 
  Manufacturing activity is steady to increasing moderately in nearly 
  all districts, but this improvement may not be reflected 
  proportionately in labor markets. District reports contain little 
  evidence of significant upward pressure on prices. While the 
  residential sector continues to improve in most districts, 
  commercial real estate markets generally remain weak. Overall loan 
  demand at financial institutions is rising slightly in most 
  districts. In agriculture, record yields of fall crops have pushed 
  prices down, but gains in the livestock sector are expected to help 
  boost overall farm income slightly.
         </p>
         <p align="left">
          <span class="content">
           <strong>
            Retail
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Sales in the holiday season posted significant year-over-year gains 
  in most districts, with mixed results in the San Francisco district 
  and in the Northeast. Sales gains were smaller in California than in 
  other states in the San Francisco district, and a minority of 
  retailers in the Boston district reported flat sales. Retailers in 
  several districts reported sales better than expected. In a number 
  of districts, merchants noted that sales gains were achieved without 
  the heavy promotions and aggressive price cutting of recent years.
          </span>
         </p>
         <p align="left">
          A wide range of merchandise apparently sold well, with some regional 
  variations. In the St. Louis district, sales mainstays included 
  jewelry and smaller appliances and electronics items. Atlanta 
  reports significant increases in sales of goods ranging from apparel 
  to big-ticket durables. In the New York district furniture and rugs 
  sold well. Merchants in the Chicago district noted that sales held 
  up well in the post-holiday period, especially sales of big ticket 
  durables, including major electronics, appliances, and furniture. 
  Retailers in the Richmond, Atlanta, St. Louis, and Kansas City 
  districts expressed optimism for further sales growth in early 1993.
         </p>
         <p align="left">
          <strong>
           Manufacturing
          </strong>
          <br/>
          Manufacturing activity is reported to be steady to increasing 
  moderately in nearly all districts. Activity appears to be flat to 
  expanding modestly in the Boston, Philadelphia, and Richmond 
  districts. Stronger but less than robust activity is reported by 
  Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, and Dallas. San Francisco 
  reports that Twelfth District manufacturing activity continues to 
  contract, due to further weakening in aerospace and defense-related 
  industries in southern California and Washington; manufacturing 
  shows an improvement, however, elsewhere in the district.
         </p>
         <p align="left">
          Manufacturing activity in the Cleveland and Chicago districts has 
  been boosted by increased motor vehicle production and related 
  increases in the output of steel and tires. As a result, Cleveland 
  reports rising capacity use ratios for some steel producers, while 
  strong demand has pushed production close to capacity for some tire 
  producers. Boston, Atlanta, and Dallas report some increases in the 
  production of housing-related products, such as furniture and 
  construction materials. Capital goods producers reported an uneven 
  but rising trend in their business, with uncertainty about a 
  possible investment tax credit leading to some postponements of 
  orders.&gt;
         </p>
         <p align="left">
          The moderate improvement in manufacturing activity may not be 
  reflected proportionately in labor markets. Boston reports that half 
  of its respondents expect their work forces to remain at the current 
  level, while the remaining respondents expect to implement 
  reductions. Most of the manufacturers contacted in the Philadelphia 
  district were holding employment steady. In the Cleveland district, 
  most manufacturers believe they can increase production with their 
  existing work forces. Some firms in the St. Louis district expect to 
  add jobs, however, and a major home appliance manufacturer has 
  recalled a large number of laid-off workers and expects to add 
  substantial new hires. In the Minneapolis district, layoffs by two 
  computer equipment firms and an airline have been partly offset by 
  new hiring elsewhere in the district.
         </p>
         <p align="left">
          <strong>
           Construction and Real Estate
          </strong>
          <br/>
          The residential sector continues to improve in most districts. Home 
  sales, as well as housing starts and permits, were generally better 
  in 1992 than in 1991. Lower mortgage rates, increased consumer 
  confidence, and pent-up demand were cited as responsible for the 
  improvement. Boston reports slow but steady improvement in its 
  residential real estate market. While Kansas City notes a recent 
  slowing in housing activity, Minneapolis reports its busiest winter 
  construction season in six years. Some glimmers of hope for 
  multifamily construction also appear, as both Atlanta and Dallas 
  report rising occupancy rates and firming rents. San Francisco 
  reports mixed conditions in its residential sector. House prices 
  have weakened further in southern California and softened in parts 
  of Washington, but have risen in Oregon and Utah.
         </p>
         <p align="left">
          Commercial real estate markets remain generally weak, but there are 
  some positive signs here and there. The office vacancy rate in 
  downtown Buffalo, while still high, fell in 1992 for the first time 
  in four years. Activity in the Richmond district's nonresidential 
  sector has increased in recent months, with vacancy rates falling in 
  some areas and more inquiries from businesses in strong financial 
  condition. Nonresidential construction has been expanding in the St. 
  Louis area, primarily in public works and new factories. Minneapolis 
  also reports a sharp rise in public works contracts, as well as in 
  construction of some new shopping malls across the district. One of 
  the new malls was built in a border town to cater to strong demand 
  by Canadian shoppers. Nonresidential real estate markets remain weak 
  in much of the Dallas and San Francisco districts. Vacancy rates are 
  still high in Dallas, but prices there have fallen enough to bring a 
  pick-up in property sales. Several markets are weak in the San 
  Francisco district, where commercial rents and property values are 
  depressed by high vacancy rates and continued employment losses.
         </p>
         <p align="left">
          <strong>
           Financial Services
          </strong>
          <br/>
          Financial institutions report a further slight increase in overall 
  loan demand in most districts. Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, 
  Atlanta, St. Louis, and Kansas City report slow growth in business 
  loans. New York reports slow growth in business loans by small and 
  midsized banks. Most districts note a drop-off in mortgage lending, 
  reflecting reduced demand for refinancing. Dallas reports little 
  change in loan demand, and San Francisco notes mixed conditions in 
  the Twelfth District. In California, loan demand is weak and the 
  volume of outstanding loans continues to fall. Son growth in loan 
  demand is evident, however, in Arizona, Utah, and Washington.
         </p>
         <p align="left">
          <strong>
           Agriculture and Resource-Related Industries
          </strong>
          <br/>
          Despite some unseasonably wet weather in parts of the Richmond, St. 
  Louis, and Kansas City districts, fall crop yields have been near 
  record levels. Large supplies of corn and soybeans have pushed 
  prices down, thus restricting income gains for crop producers. But 
  lower crop prices also mean lower feed prices and likely income 
  gains for livestock producers. Overall, farm income is expected to 
  be up slightly in 1993 and farm operators are seen as likely to 
  maintain their solid financial condition.
         </p>
         <p align="left">
          &gt;Metal mining continues to be weak in the Minneapolis district, where 
  slack orders have led to two iron mine shutdowns and substantial 
  layoffs. Dallas reports a slowing in energy industry activity, 
  although Kansas City cites a recent rise in the number of operating 
  drilling rigs in its district. Both districts agree that drilling is 
  likely to drop sharply in the near term, however, because certain 
  tax incentives for drilling expired at the end of 1992. Dallas also 
  notes that low margins have led many refiners to reduce their 
  capacity.
         </p>
         <p align="left">
          Conditions in the lumber and wood products industry vary somewhat 
  across the nation. St. Louis notes that orders at southern pine 
  lumber mills are down slightly, although production remains well 
  above last year's level. San Francisco reports that orders for wood 
  products are firm and inventories are low, while Minneapolis reports 
  strong demand for lumber and for plywood substitutes.
