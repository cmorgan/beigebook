          National Summary

         <p>
          <strong>
           January 15, 2003
          </strong>
         </p>
         <p>
          Reports from the twelve Federal Reserve Districts indicated subdued growth in economic activity from mid-November through early January, with little change in overall conditions relative to the last survey period.  Most Districts characterized growth as "sluggish" or economic activity as "soft" or "subdued."  The weakest report came from Dallas, where economic activity "remained anemic."  As in the last survey, conditions in the New York, Philadelphia, and Cleveland Districts were more favorable overall than in other Districts, with each, especially New York, describing various signs of improvement.
         </p>
         <p>
          Reports on consumer spending were consistently weak, with disappointing holiday sales that, in nominal terms, mostly were at or below last year's levels.  Automobile sales surged at year-end in response to favorable sales incentives.  Manufacturers expanded production a bit on balance, with notable gains for defense-related and biomedical products.  Providers of nonfinancial services saw little change in existing weak demand, and business travel remained slow, although there were some reports of improved performance in the tourism sector. Home sales and residential construction activity remained at high levels but slowed a bit in some areas, and the widespread overhang of commercial real estate persisted.  Agricultural production was hampered by adverse weather in some areas and performance was mixed.  Extraction activity in the energy sector responded very little to sharp increases in energy prices.  Bank lending continued to expand in most Districts due to strength in consumer and real estate borrowing.  Labor demand was mostly flat, and despite rising costs for employee benefits and some inputs, increases in employee compensation and final prices were held down by competitive supply conditions.

          <strong>
           Consumer Spending
          </strong>
          <br/>
          <span class="content">
           Most Districts reported disappointing retail 
              sales revenues during the survey period, with holiday season spending 
              that was flat or down a bit compared with spending in the previous 
              year. In Cleveland, sales were "very poor," with most respondents 
              reporting declines of 1 percent to 10 percent from year-earlier 
              levels; San Francisco reported "lackluster" sales that were "well 
              below [retailers'] expectations." Most other Districts saw flat 
              sales, although Richmond and Minneapolis noted scattered reports 
              of solid sales growth, largely due to strength in post-Christmas 
              purchases. A relatively short holiday season and inclement weather 
              in some areas played small roles in holding sales down.
          </span>
         </p>
         <p>
          <span class="content">
           In most areas, sales were stronger at large 
              discount chains than at traditional, higher-priced department and 
              specialty stores. Consistent with these observations, substantial 
              discounting on holiday retail sales items was reported in all Districts, 
              with Chicago explicitly noting deeper discounting compared with 
              a year earlier. New York and Philadelphia reported moderate accumulation 
              in retail inventories, but other Districts reported generally balanced 
              inventories, due to a combination of conservative planning and the 
              dominant role of low prices rather than low sales volume in determining 
              weak nominal sales revenues.
          </span>
         </p>
         <p class="content">
          Among product lines, the strongest holiday sales 
              were recorded for consumer electronics and toys. Automobile sales 
              showed signs of weakening in some areas, but according to Philadelphia, 
              Cleveland, and Chicago, favorable year-end financing and price incentives 
              produced a sales flurry in late December, lifting overall sales 
              to high levels for the survey period.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Manufacturing
          </strong>
          <br/>
          The manufacturing sector continued to struggle with weak demand and excess capacity, although, on balance, slight improvement was evident.  The strongest report came from New York, where manufacturers statewide reported increases in new orders, shipments, and hours worked and were "overwhelmingly optimistic" about the near-term outlook.  Overall activity was flat to up slightly in most other Districts.  However, Kansas City reported weakened activity in December after signs of stabilization earlier, and St. Louis reported widespread announcements of employment cuts among manufacturers of durable and nondurable products.
         </p>
         <p>
          Demand for high-tech products was flat or improved a bit in Dallas and San Francisco, with the latter reporting increased sales of semiconductors for use in wireless technologies.  Boston, Atlanta, Kansas City, and San Francisco cited sales gains for pharmaceuticals, medical equipment, and defense-related equipment.  Manufacturing activity increased slightly in the Minneapolis District, with expanding capacity and production levels reported in the heavy machinery, metals, and electronics sectors.  Automobile manufacturers in the Cleveland and Chicago Districts faced mostly stable demand, with a sales surge at the end of the year helping to bring inventories down from November's excessive levels.  Declines in construction-related manufacturing were reported in Chicago and Dallas, and Richmond reported weak demand conditions for apparel manufacturers.
         </p>
         <p>
          Most Districts reported little or no increase in capital spending by manufacturers.  Atlanta noted declining demand for capital goods, and Kansas City indicated that capital spending fell in December after having firmed in October and November.  Looking ahead, Philadelphia reported that the number of firms intending to boost capital spending in the first half of 2003 fell recently, and capital spending among manufacturers in the San Francisco District is being held down by excess capacity that is expected to persist for six months or more at the current pace of expansion.

           Demand for business and professional services was somewhat weak 
              and, overall, exhibited little change from the previous survey period. 
              Philadelphia and Richmond described overall demand for services 
              as "flat" or "steady." Dallas noted slow demand for accounting and 
              legal services, and in the San Francisco District demand for advertising 
              and related media services was soft. Boston reported good sales 
              and revenues for insurance companies but noted that poor investment 
              results kept hiring and capital spending frozen. Demand for trucking 
              services remained strong in the Cleveland District despite a slowdown 
              in December that was larger than the usual seasonal lull, and St. 
              Louis reported steady demand for trucking but uneven profits due 
              to rising fuel costs. Relative to seasonal norms, hiring or planned 
              hiring of temporary service workers was slow in Philadelphia, Richmond, 
              and Dallas. By contrast, New York reported "brisk," broad-based 
              hiring of temps in December.

           Performance indicators 
              in the travel and tourism sector were mixed. New York reported higher 
              hotel occupancy and room rates compared with a year earlier. In 
              the Atlanta District, hotel bookings in tourist areas have climbed 
              back near their levels from the year 2000, although convention business 
              in Atlanta has been hampered by persistent weakness in business 
              travel. Atlanta and Richmond indicated that travelers are delaying 
              travel plans to an unusual degree, and New York noted that recent 
              figures on advance ticket sales for Broadway theaters were running 
              15 percent below a year earlier. Because of favorable weather conditions, 
              early season ski receipts were excellent in the Richmond, Kansas 
              City, and San Francisco Districts. However, Richmond reported weakened 
              tourism in coastal areas, and Minneapolis reported sparse snow and 
              a slow start to its winter sports season. In the San Francisco District, 
              hotel occupancies have returned to normal in Hawaii but have been 
              low elsewhere. Demand for airline services generally remained weak, 
              although Dallas noted that holiday travel for some airlines was 
              better than expected.

            Real Estate and 
              Construction
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Residential construction activity and home sales remained at high 
              levels in most Districts, although there were numerous reports of 
              slight cooling in market activity. Reported activity was strongest 
              in the Richmond District, where growth in home sales remained strong 
              and the housing market was described as "tremendously active." Market 
              activity was down somewhat in the Boston, New York, Cleveland, Chicago, 
              Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts, due in part to normal 
              seasonal slowing. St. Louis indicated that home demand may be leveling 
              off. In Atlanta, home sales fell in December after an increase in 
              November. Construction activity was at "low levels" in the Dallas 
              District, although lower-priced homes (below $250,000) sold "briskly." 
              Boston, Atlanta, and Chicago also reported stronger demand for mid- 
              and entry-level homes and condominiums than for more expensive residences.

          <span class="content">
           The markets for commercial 
              real estate continued to exhibit substantial slack in all Districts. 
              Richmond and St. Louis described demand for office and industrial 
              space as "sluggish" or "slow," while office vacancy rates increased 
              slightly in Minneapolis-St. Paul, the city of Chicago, and parts 
              of the Kansas City District. In the Cleveland District, commercial 
              building activity remained at low levels, but builders reported 
              a significant increase in the number of prospective projects. Minneapolis 
              reported low vacancy rates for retail space and a corresponding 
              increase in planned retail construction. Although San Francisco 
              reported a decline in office vacancies in Los Angeles, contacts 
              from that District and Dallas expect little overall change in commercial 
              construction activity over the next two years.

            Agriculture and 
              Natural Resources
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Agricultural output and performance was mixed across Districts, 
              as adverse weather conditions hampered agricultural production activity 
              in some areas. Chicago reported high yields and high prices for 
              a variety of crops. There and in the St. Louis District, the value 
              of farmland rose markedly, and bankers in the Kansas City District 
              reported good credit quality for their farm loan portfolios. San 
              Francisco noted improved sales of agricultural products, due in 
              part to increased overseas demand spurred by the weaker dollar. 
              By contrast, Minneapolis reported deterioration in performance in 
              the agricultural sector. Moreover, heavy rain and otherwise inclement 
              weather limited yields and production activity for a wide variety 
              of crops in the Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, and Dallas Districts, 
              while lack of moisture is likely to limit yields for the winter 
              wheat crops in Minneapolis and Kansas City.

           Activity in the energy 
              and mining sectors was flat or up slightly on net. Mining activity 
              in the Minneapolis District continued at high levels. Minneapolis 
              and Kansas City reported no change in extraction activities for 
              oil and natural gas, and Dallas reported only a slight increase, 
              despite a sharp rise in the prices of oil and natural gas. In addition, 
              Dallas noted that inventories of natural gas and crude oil were 
              well below year-earlier levels.

           Loan demand was up on net, mainly reflecting strength in consumer

              By contrast, Philadelphia reported modest increases in all categories. 
              Contacts in New York and St. Louis saw a pickup in commercial and

              areas, especially for home financing. However, household loan demand

            Employment and Wages
           </strong>
           <br/>
           In most Districts, firms remained very cautious in their hiring 
              decisions and most categories of labor were in ample supply. Continued 
              layoffs in a variety of industries were reported in several Districts, 
              most notably St. Louis and San Francisco. The labor market in New 
              York was described as "slack" overall, despite a reported increase 
              in hiring of temporary services workers. Among Districts, only Minneapolis 
              reported some tightening in labor markets. In Cleveland, labor markets 
              were "stable." Upward wage pressure was described as "subdued" in 
              Chicago and Kansas City and restrained by a weak labor market in 
              San Francisco. Minneapolis reported modest wage increases (about 
              2 percent) compared with a year earlier, and Boston noted that some 
              firms plan to ease restrictions on pay increases in 2003. Kansas 
              City noted that the only categories of labor in short supply were 
              health-care workers and some construction tradesmen, and Atlanta 
              reported double-digit yearly wage increases for hospital workers. 
              Contacts in Atlanta and Minneapolis cited sharp increases in employer 
              costs for employee health coverage. Chicago and San Francisco reported 
              that firms are responding to increased health costs by passing on 
              a portion to employees through rising direct contributions or reductions 
              in other components of compensation.

            Prices
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Despite rising costs for energy and other inputs, upward movement 
              in the prices of final goods and services was quite limited. Chicago 
              noted rising input costs for steel, packaging, and electronic components, 
              but pointed to "fierce competition" as the main factor holding down 
              prices for final goods. Kansas City also pointed to rising materials 
              costs for manufacturers, although it noted that steel prices fell 
              recently and prices of finished goods continued to decline. Several 
              Districts reported a sharp increase in fuel costs in December. As 
              noted by Dallas, however, stiff competition limited the impact of 
              rising energy costs to reduced profit margins on some intermediate 
              goods rather than increased prices of final goods.
