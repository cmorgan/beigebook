            Overview
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Economic conditions deteriorated further during November, 
according to the District reports. Growth in consumer spending 
slowed or tell in many regions. The slump in manufacturing worsened, 
and layoffs, production cuts, and plant shutdowns appeared to be 
spreading. Residential construction failed to revive despite a 
decline in interest rates. Nonresidential construction activity 
continued strong in some Districts. While consumer lending remained 
soft, business borrowing strengthened in a few Districts. Low prices 
depressed agricultural incomes and created anxiety about farmers' 
abilities to meet loan obligations. Economists have revised their 
forecasts of near-term economic growth sharply downward. Many 
believe the downturn will reach the trough by the first or second 
quarter of 1981 and that the economy will then rally over the second 
half of the year.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Consumer Spending
           </strong>
           <br/>
           The retail sector was soft throughout the country 
during November. Many areas experienced reduced sales growth or 
actual declines, although the pace improved after Thanksgiving in 
the Northeast. Real sales, however, were lower in Richmond, Atlanta, 
Chicago, and Minneapolis. After falling in October, nominal retail 
spending in San Francisco recouped the loss in November, but in real 
terms holiday expenditures are not expected to reach last year's 
mark. Although high quality products were selling better than low-
cost goods in Boston, durables and other big-ticket items were 
moving especially slowly in many other locations. Merchants in 
numerous Districts were counting on a late surge to produce an 
acceptable holiday season, with some stores relying on heavy 
promotions and price markdowns to increase activity. Despite the 
overall sluggishness in retail sales, inventories were mentioned as 
a problem in only five Districts. No improvement in automobile sales 
was evident, and dealers in Cleveland were prepared for one of the 
worst months ever.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Manufacturing
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Manufacturing activity nationwide appeared to be 
worsening from last month's depressed levels. All Districts reported 
drops in new orders or shipments for at least some industries. Hard 
hit by the downturn were producers of capital goods, building 
materials, textiles, paper, steel, and consumer durables. Even 
demand for high technology products has slipped. Difficult 
conditions persisted in mining in Minneapolis and San Francisco. 
Strong spots were noted in defense industries in Boston and New York 
and energy-related industries in St. Louis and Cleveland. Layoffs 
rose in all Districts but Dallas. Manufacturers in Philadelphia and 
Chicago indicated an easing of price pressures.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Construction
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Residential construction and home sales remained 
virtually at a standstill, as little additional activity resulted 
from recent declines in interest rates. Housing prices have begun to 
fall in Atlanta and Chicago, but Dallas reported that further 
interest rate reductions were likely to cause prices to jump 
sharply.
          </p>
          <p>
           Nonresidential construction continued to be strong in New York, St. 
Louis, and Dallas. Office construction in Chicago received a boost 
when financing problems were resolved for some large projects. 
Richmond, Atlanta, and San Francisco had moderate activity in the 
nonresidential sector.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Financial Developments
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Consumer loans continued to languish, but 
increased demand for business loans was observed in some areas. In 
Philadelphia, consumer loans declined by as much as 20 percent. In 
contrast, business loans were rising in New York, Philadelphia, 
Kansas City, and Dallas. Inventory financing, mergers, cash 
shortages, energy development, and below-prime lending were cited as 
factors contributing to the upturn.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Agriculture
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Although good-to-excellent crops were reported in 
several Districts, lower-than-expected prices were reducing net 
returns in agriculture. Consequently, the financial positions of 
farmers prompted growing concern. In Kansas City, the low prices 
prevented any improvement in customers' creditworthiness as interest 
rates fell. Agricultural loan delinquencies continued to climb in 
Atlanta, but lenders hoped foreclosures could be held to moderate 
levels. In Dallas, private lenders were carefully watching their 
agricultural loan portfolios, although few immediate problems were 
foreseen.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            The Outlook
           </strong>
           <br/>
           In the face of widespread sluggishness, economists 
lowered their forecasts of real GNP growth. Fourth quarter declines 
are projected to be as large as 7 percent, but the recession is 
generally expected to bottom out in the first or second quarter of 
1982. Many observers anticipated a strong recovery by the second 
half of the year, although Chicago warned that any subsequent upturn 
expected next year; would leave that District far short of full 
prosperity. Manufacturers differed about when they thought that 
business would pick up. At the extremes, Philadelphia firms hoped 
for expanding orders between now and June, while many Richmond 
companies believed the slump will deepen over the same period. Fears 
that increased inflation will accompany the recovery were voiced.
