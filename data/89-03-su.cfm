          <p>
           Economic activity for most of the country is reported to be 
expanding at a moderately strong pace. Consumer spending, except for 
autos, has apparently gained momentum while manufacturing, 
especially for export, continues to show strength almost everywhere. 
Energy and, to a lesser extent construction, remain the weakest 
sectors.
          </p>
          <p>
           In this environment, there is evidence of pressures on costs and 
prices. Despite additions to productive capacity and improvements in 
efficiency that are forestalling widespread bottlenecks, materials 
and product prices are edging up, albeit sporadically and at an 
uneven pace. Labor markets continue to tighten, with labor shortages 
noted for both skilled and unskilled workers. Due largely to 
weather, there are also indications of present and possible future 
price pressures in agriculture.
          </p>
          <p>
           Aside from widespread evidence of cost and price pressures, several 
imbalances are reported. There are signs that excess construction 
inventories are being perpetuated in some areas. Also while reports 
of credit problems are isolated, deposit growth is generally weak.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Consumer Spending
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Most Districts reported strong gains in consumer expenditures for 
January and February, with the exception of autos. Growing shortages 
of retail workers as well as other cost and price pressures were 
noted in a few Districts. Apparel sales, particularly women's 
clothing, contributed significantly to strength. Some Districts also 
pointed to brisk purchases of home furnishings and electronics. In 
contrast, new car sales have slowed and new incentive programs are 
said to be needed to reduce higher-than-usual inventories. General 
merchandise inventory levels are typically viewed as lean.
          </p>
          <p>
           General merchandisers are typically optimistic about spring sales, 
although Philadelphia expressed concern that an early Easter this 
year could lower overall sales n advance of the holiday. In a number 
of Districts, retailers expressed uncertainty about the long range 
outlook.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Manufacturing
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Most Districts cited some tightness in manufacturing labor markets 
or the Districts that reported on costs and prices, most anticipate 
increasing pressures due either to current strong conditions or 
attempts to pass through last year's large increases for particular 
inputs. In other Districts such as Philadelphia and Boston, more 
moderate pressures were reported.
          </p>
          <p>
           Manufacturers generally are optimistic about near-term production 
prospects, frequently because exports are outpacing growth in 
domestic demand. Orders for producers durables are strong in the 
Districts where this industry is relatively important to the 
economy. Aside from machine tools and the like, transportation 
equipment sales are also strong. Factory orders for apparel are up 
strongly in Dallas, and apparel and textiles production is 
rebounding in Richmond and St. Louis. Production for defense is 
generally reported as weak except in the St. Louis District, where 
backlogs are supporting activity. The paper and chemical industries 
continue to turn in strong performances according to Dallas and 
Atlanta, although their growth rates have slowed recently.
          </p>
          <p>
           As far as capital spending is concerned, some of the largest and 
most broad-based increases are noted by Chicago. However, in the 
industries where reports were obtained on capital spending, it was 
generally not expected to exceed last year's strong pace. Often, 
investment was said to be improving efficiency and modernizing 
equipment rather than for expanding capacity. While industries in 
several Districts are said to be operating close to full capacity, 
there are few comments about serious bottlenecks. In this regard, 
Chicago and Richmond note capital spending directed towards reducing 
bottlenecks. San Francisco reports one of the exceptionsâ€”capacity 
constraints are binding and long delivery times typify production of 
commercial aircraft and aerospace supplies.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Construction
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Comments characterize housing and real estate activity as ranging 
from stable growth to weakness. Several of the Districts that 
reported on this noted high vacancy rates in this area. In 
construction, multifamily appears weaker than single-family 
homebuilding almost everywhere.
          </p>
          <p>
           Nonresidential activity also reflects a heavy inventory condition in 
several of the Districts that reviewed this. At the same time, 
building is strong in the St. Louis and Chicago Districts, 
reflecting industrial expansion in the latter. Chicago also reports 
very heavy demand for construction steel, whereas in other Districts 
softening domestic demand for construction materials was seen.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Resource-Related Industry
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Several Districts noted a cautious optimism in resource-related 
industries. Expectations of higher farm income are fairly widespread 
and export demand for several products, such as lumber, shows 
continued strength.
          </p>
          <p>
           Of the nine Districts that reported on agriculture, four observed 
concerns that soil moisture problems could threaten crops. The 
winter wheat crop is already threatened in a number of Districts 
with the exception of Richmond. The effect of herd reduction during 
last year's drought has pushed cattle prices higher. Descriptions of 
the energy industry suggest continued weakness.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Financial Services
           </strong>
           <br/>
           The comments on loan demand suggest little growth, with the 
exception of Philadelphia. Two Districts reported no trend in 
delinquencies and San Francisco indicated credit standards for auto 
loans were tightening. Some others indicated that concerns were 
expressed about forthcoming upward adjustments in rates on 
outstanding ARMs. Atlanta noted that delinquencies, defaults and 
bankruptcies are on the rise in real estate, with developers in 
certain overbuilt areas under pressure. Deposit growth was described 
as weak by all of the Districts that reported on this. Two noted 
deposit outflows at thrift institutions in recent months.
