          The general tenor of the twelve Red Book reports may he summed up as 
follows: a present business situation that is generating little 
enthusiasm; an emphasis on uncertainty, perhaps even greater than 
usual; and a future viewed with some optimism. This generalization 
alone of course conceals a range of views, especially for the 
present situation: "sluggish" conditions are reported from 
Philadelphia and Cleveland, while Boston and Dallas report "good" or 
improving" conditions, and some Atlanta District businessmen suggest 
that pessimism has been exaggerated." The consensus is greater, 
however, on the existence and retarding influence of uncertainty—more than a little of which emerges from the presently unknown 
influence of Phase II policies and their implementation. Yet, 
expressions of optimism for the months ahead are found throughout 
the various Bank reports.
         </p>
         <p align="left">
          As might be expected in a period of uncertainty and adjustment to 
new policies, considerable variations of opinion were gathered by 
the Reserve Banks from respondents to their inquiries. In 
construction, for example, the Richmond Bank reports some slackening 
in both residential and nonresidential building; in Chicago, 
residential vacancy rates are up and new permit issuance has slowed 
down; and construction activity has tended to level off recently in 
St. Louis. On the other hand, continued strength in construction is 
reported from Atlanta, Kansas City, and San Francisco. Several Banks 
found mortgage money abundant, and rates and terms easing. Saving 
and loan savings inflows remain strong, and life insurance companies
also reportedly have ample funds and are in search of investment 
opportunities.
         </p>
         <p align="left">
          Consumer spending, past and expected, also varies considerably from 
District to District. On balance, there does not seem to be great 
strength in this sector. Retailers contacted by the New York Bank 
expect a "good, if not spectacular, holiday season," an attitude 
shared to a greater or lesser extent by merchants in the Kansas 
City, Dallas, Minneapolis, and San Francisco districts. Prospects 
might be thought a little brighter in the Richmond and St. Louis 
areas; a little dimmer in the Philadelphia area.
         </p>
         <p align="left">
          Those Banks remarking on inventory investment nearly all cast some 
doubt on a sudden rise in the rate of inventory accumulation. The 
New York Bank's respondents see no significant pickup in business 
inventory spending, a view seconded in the Boston report. In the 
Dallas District, where sales have been slow recently, retail 
inventories are described as "excessive," and St. Louis reports that 
retail inventories there are not growing with sales. In the San 
Francisco District, inventories are being "deliberately kept low and 
geared to sales," while Chicago states that "Inventories continue 
under tight control." In a somewhat different view, the Richmond 
Bank notes some recent slight increases in manufacturers' 
inventories, but finds retail inventories declining to more desired 
levels.
         </p>
         <p align="left">
          The steel industry's position was commented on specifically in the 
Chicago and Cleveland reports. Steel orders—"disappointing" overall, 
but variable from firm to firm and plant to plant—appear to be in 
for gradual improvement, bringing operations back to "normal" next 
year for the entire industry. In the meantime, the steel industry is 
"depressed" as the inventory liquidation is prolonged by increased 
imports and lower-than-expected current consumption of steel.
         </p>
         <p align="left">
          While the steel situation has combined with several strikes to bring 
recent employment declines in the Cleveland District, employment 
growth is lagging in other Districts, too. Philadelphia reports 
little new manufacturing employment, a condition expected to extend 
into the immediate future. Some slight improvement in employment in 
scattered areas of the New York District is apparently bringing 
little improvement in overall unemployment. Employers in the Boston 
District note that, with capacity use rates so low, a sizable rise 
in demand will be needed before employment is expanded. Yet, 
improving employment situations are reported in the Atlanta, Dallas, 
and Richmond districts.
         </p>
         <p align="left">
          The relatively few comments on business capital spending indicate no 
current spurt in such activity. However, there has been some 
increase in purchases of heavy trucks, construction and materials 
handling equipment, and especially of farm machinery. Both the 
Minneapolis and Kansas City Banks commented that the investment tax 
credit might be partly responsible for the latter, along with the 
harvesting of bumper crops and rising farm income. Agribusiness 
firms generally are quite optimistic about their future sales 
prospects.
         </p>
         <p align="left">
          There was agreement on the Atlantic and Pacific Coasts on the 
frailty of business loan demand and its relationship to the moderate 
pace of economic activity. The New York Bank noted that "the demand 
for business loans does not suggest any quickening in the pace of 
business activity," and the San Francisco Bank commented as follows: 
".... with few exceptions, bankers describe business loan demand as 
weak, reflecting the moderate pace of business spending." Business 
loan demand was only "seasonal" in the Philadelphia area; "slow, and 
weaker than usual" in the Chicago District; and weak at major banks 
in the Eighth District. In the Kansas City District, however, 
business loans were stronger in November than in other recent 
months.
         </p>
         <p align="left">
          The range of feelings expressed about Phase II include uncertainty, 
skepticism, and optimism. Several businessmen in the St. Louis 
District feel that the new programs have hindered business spending 
so far, and some "see little hope for improvement in prices and 
profits." Some respondents in the Chicago District feel that 
sufficient price rises will not be allowed to keep up with cost 
increases. A major fear, expressed in the New York report and 
implied in the reports from San Francisco and Chicago, is that 
controls on prices will be more effective than those on wages, and 
that a profit squeeze will result, especially for large companies. 
While not overly optimistic about the program's complete success, 
there was an attitude that its influence would be 
favorable—"better 
than nothing," with "a 50-50 per cent chance of 'crudely and 
clumsily' moderating the pace of inflation," according to one 
director of the New York Bank. As the San Francisco Bank aptly 
concluded: "Overall, Phase II was greeted with less enthusiasm than 
Phase I, because its duration and character are more difficult to 
assess."
