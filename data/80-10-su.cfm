            Overview
           </strong>
           <br/>
           With respect to current and prospective business activity, 
reports from Reserve Banks this month are generally less optimistic 
than they were last month. The recent deterioration in financial 
conditions is seen as responsible for a slowing of economic activity 
in several districts in September. The rise in interest rates is the 
major reason many respondents have adopted a less sanguine view of 
the strength of the recovery next year. The outlook for inflation is 
about unchanged from last month, with some districts reporting an 
easing of price pressures and others reporting a resurgence. While 
commercial lending is up in several districts, mortgage lending has 
slackened everywhere. Automobile dealers are "cautiously optimistic"
on balance about the prospects for the 1981 model year, although 
there is widespread concern that the combination of high prices and 
high financing costs will dampen new car sales. However, most 
respondents agree that it is too soon to know if these factors will 
significantly weaken car sales in the months ahead.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Business Conditions and Outlook
           </strong>
           <br/>
           With few exceptions the recent rise 
in interest rates apparently has stalled the recovery and caused 
many respondents to revise downward their forecasts for 1981, 
judging from Reserve Bank reports. Boston and St. Louis report 
little change in business conditions since last month, while the 
recession is still on in San Francisco. Defense spending is 
mentioned as a source of strength by Boston and Dallas, but in the 
latter case this is offset by an expected decline in construction 
caused by rising interest rates. The effect of higher interest rates 
on construction also has slowed the recovery in Minneapolis. 
Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, and Chicago say that business has 
improved since last month, but Cleveland and Chicago are concerned 
that the recent improvement in steel demand may evaporate if high 
prices and interest rates weaken auto sales next year. Respondents 
in New York do not expect the economy to improve significantly 
before the middle of next year, and Atlanta and Kansas City note 
that the rise in interest rates has caused growing concern about the 
future in their districts as well.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Prices
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Where mentioned, district reports indicate that price 
pressures are about unchanged from last month. While Dallas notes 
that lumber prices are off significantly from a year ago and 
purchasing agents in Boston and Kansas City report a stabilization 
of input prices in recent months, surveys conducted in Philadelphia 
and Chicago indicated that industrial input and output prices are 
rising and probably will continue to do so for the rest of the year.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Financial Developments
           </strong>
           <br/>
           The most notable feature of district reports 
was the widespread decline in mortgage lending due to recent 
interest rate increases. New York and St. Louis report an increase 
in the use of VRMs and RRMs; Atlanta notes that equity participation 
mortgages issued by a Florida S&amp;L have been well received. Auto 
loans are available and rates and terms generally are unchanged from 
last month. Business loan demand is strong in Philadelphia, 
Cleveland, and St. Louis. Deposits are up in Kansas City and Dallas 
but down in San Francisco.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Consumer Spending
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Although retail sales are reported as steady or 
up slightly (Boston, Cleveland, Richmond, St. Louis, Minneapolis, 
Kansas City, Dallas), mixed (New York, Philadelphia), or sluggish 
(Atlanta, Chicago, San Francisco), the overall tone of the district 
reports indicates that consumer spending remains flat in real terms. 
Hard goods are doing relatively well in Philadelphia, consumers 
buying in advance of price increases have buoyed big ticket sales in 
Richmond, catalog shopping is growing in Atlanta, price cutting and 
sales are common in Chicago, St. Louis and San Francisco, and soft 
goods are doing better than durables in Kansas City and Dallas. Auto 
sales are the best in months in Cleveland and are up a bit in 
Minneapolis, but other districts report car sales are flat or down 
slightly. Chicago notes that auto loans are available at commercial 
banks in the 14-16 percent range but that lenders are becoming more 
selective; Cleveland and Kansas City note that in-house financing at 
below market rates still is available for some makes; New York, 
Atlanta, Chicago, and Dallas note that the high interest rates are 
reducing dealers' desired inventories of new cars. High new car 
prices seem to be at least as important as high interest rates in 
explaining weak car sales. Most districts conclude that it is too 
soon to tell what effect these factors will have on 1981 sales 
volume, however.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Residential Construction
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Conditions in the housing market have 
deteriorated in the past month in all districts. Higher mortgage 
rates are cited by all Reserve Banks as the cause of the downturn. 
Rates have increased as much as two percentage points in some 
districts (New York, Chicago, St. Louis, Kansas City) and mortgage 
demand has dried up almost everywhere. Descriptions of the housing 
market range from severely depressed (Chicago) to weak (Richmond) 
with no district citing improved conditions.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Business Fixed Investment
           </strong>
           <br/>
           The outlook for capital spending is 
mixed. Cleveland, Chicago, and St. Louis see a continued gradual 
downward trend in overall spending plans. Cleveland and Chicago also 
note that order cancellations are becoming a problem, although not 
as severe as in the last recession. On the other hand, Philadelphia 
reports that increased capital outlays are planned at a third of the 
firms they surveyed; Atlanta says that order backlogs at high 
technology firms are the highest ever; Dallas cites an ongoing boom 
in oil drilling, commercial building, and power plant construction; 
and New York, Cleveland, and Chicago report strength in sales of 
machine tools.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Inventories
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Both retail and manufacturing inventories are described 
as lean but generally acceptable by most districts. New York, 
Chicago, and Minneapolis note that high carrying costs have reduced 
desired inventories of some respondents, especially automobile 
dealers.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Agriculture
           </strong>
           <br/>
           The outlook for agricultural production and farm income 
is mixed. Drought has reduced crop yields in Richmond, Atlanta, St. 
Louis, and Dallas. The resulting price increases are not expected 
fully to offset the decline in output in these areas, so farm income 
probably will decrease further. Atlanta and Dallas also note a heavy 
use of emergency credit in their districts. While Kansas City 
expects meat supplies to tighten next year, San Francisco expects 
them to increase. Chicago and Minneapolis are optimistic about the 
corn and soybean harvests this year, both citing favorable weather 
and high prices.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Academic and Financial Consultants
           </strong>
           <br/>
           The academic consultants agreed 
about the current state of the economy but disagreed about monetary 
policy. Professor Houthakker believes the economy is stagnant and 
will remain so for another year at least. He thinks the weak economy 
has restrained price increases, and he expects a modest improvement 
in the balance of payments and the exchange rate in 1981. Professor 
Samuelson foresees a weak recovery during the coming year. It is his 
view that the money growth targets for 1981 are consistent with this 
outlook and probably will not induce additional weakness. Professor 
Eckstein thinks the recession is over but that real GNP will expand 
only 1.9 percent in 1981. He believes 1981 money growth targets may 
be inconsistent with the prospective growth of the economy. 
Professor Tobin thinks that the money growth targets for next year 
are unrealistically low given the high core inflation rate and 
probably will cause stagnation. He advocates an incomes policy to 
alter wage and price behavior in addition to restrictive monetary 
and fiscal policies.
          </p>
          <p>
           The financial consultants urge the Fed to hit its money growth 
targets. Mr. Riefler argues that the Fed will gain credibility and 
reduce inflationary expectations only by hitting its announced 
targets. Mr. Schott believes that the recent round of interest rate 
increases is related to the deteriorating Federal budget outlook for 
next year. He thinks another crunch can be averted if the Fed stands 
firm now. Provided that Ml does not erupt again, reigniting concerns 
over further interest rate increases, Mr. Wojnilower expects a 
relatively strong recovery in 1981.
