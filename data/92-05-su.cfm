           According to contacts across the country, economic activity has 
increased further since the last survey although conditions remain 
uneven across regions and sectors. The Chicago, Atlanta, Richmond, 
and Cleveland districts report noticeable improvement, while the 
Dallas, St. Louis, Kansas City, and Minneapolis districts report 
continued moderate rates of economic expansion. The San Francisco, 
New York, Boston and Philadelphia districts report continued 
sluggish economic activity. These districts, however, report either 
slightly improved conditions or increased optimism about the near-
term outlook.
          </p>
          <p>
           Manufacturing activity has picked up in most regions of the country. 
Continued growth in residential construction has been widespread. 
Many districts report gains in retail sales. Several regions, 
however, report continued declines in commercial construction, 
energy extraction and defense manufacturing. While the demand for 
non-mortgage loans generally is reported as weak, there has been 
some pickup in demand for these loans in several regions. Producer 
and consumer prices are reported as generally stable.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Retail
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Retail sales have increased in most regions and many districts 
report improved optimism about future sales. Sales of most product 
lines have improved. The Chicago and Richmond districts note 
particular strength in consumer durables such as home furnishings 
and appliances. Several other districts note gains in nondurables. 
Retail respondents in the Chicago area note that much of the lost 
sales due to recent flooding downtown was made up by increased sales 
in the surrounding areas. Auto sales have increased in many areas. 
The most notable exception to improved retail sales is found in the 
Philadelphia district which reported a recent decline in sales. The 
San Francisco, New York and Boston districts report mixed retail 
performance.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Manufacturing
           </strong>
           <br/>
           The most significant change since the last Beige Book survey appears 
to have occurred in the manufacturing sector. While respondents in 
the last survey generally described the manufacturing sector as 
weak, respondents have been significantly more upbeat recently. The 
Chicago and Cleveland districts report some improvement in motor 
vehicle and steel production and pronounced gains in orders for 
capital goods such as machinery and electrical equipment. 
Respondents in the Richmond district note strong increases in 
shipments and orders across many industries.
          </p>
          <p>
           Respondents in the Atlanta and Dallas districts report strong gains 
in manufacturing industries tied to residential construction and 
moderate gains in industries such as apparel, paper and electronics. 
However, the manufacturing gains in the Dallas district have been 
offset somewhat by continued declines in energy-related industries 
such as oil field equipment. The San Francisco and Boston districts 
note continued weakness in defense-related manufacturing.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Construction
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Residential construction has continued to increase in most districts 
although the rate of growth appears to have slowed. The San 
Francisco district reports widespread gains in residential 
construction; the New York district reports increased optimism from 
home builders; and the Philadelphia district reports an overall 
slight increase in home construction. Several districts report 
increased pressure on home prices partly due to sharp increases in 
the cost of lumber. Respondents report that lumber prices have 
increased because of a sharp rise in lumber demand, harvesting 
restrictions and a recent trade levy on Canadian lumber. Commercial 
construction remains weak in most markets.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Services
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Tourism and convention activity is increasing in the Atlanta, 
Dallas, Minneapolis and Richmond districts. Respondents in the San 
Francisco district report continued weakness in newspaper 
advertising revenue, due partly to low levels of real estate 
advertising. Residential real estate brokerage activity is reported 
to have increased in most markets across the country. The Dallas 
district reports that the demand for legal and litigation services 
remains strong and that accounting and consulting firms are seeing 
an increase in demand from companies seeking to increase 
productivity.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Agriculture and Energy Extraction
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Several districts report favorable agricultural conditions although 
extreme weather has slowed planting in some areas of the county. 
Kansas City and St. Louis report that the winter wheat crop is in 
mostly good condition. Agricultural prices have generally declined. 
Although cattle prices remain at very high levels, Kansas City 
reports that cattle feeders remain wary that sluggish consumer 
demand for beef could trigger another drop in prices later this 
summer. Several districts report ample liquidity for agricultural 
lending.
          </p>
          <p>
           The energy sector continues to decline. Oil and natural gas prices 
remain at low levels, and the drilling rig count continues to fall. 
Oil and gas industry respondents in the Atlanta district report that 
business activity continues to decline and that further layoffs are 
likely over the next few months. St. Louis reports that year-to-date 
coal production has declined about 6 percent from a year earlier.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Bank Lending
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Bankers in several regions report that loan demand has begun to 
increase, although demand remains uneven. Most banks across the 
country report an increase in mortgage originations and a slowdown 
in mortgage refinancings. Most regions continue to report soft 
demand for non-mortgage loans. The Richmond, Dallas and St. Louis 
districts report increases in non-mortgage loans. Boston reports 
that some small businesses continue to have difficulty obtaining 
bank credit, but contacts have found satisfactory alternatives, 
particularly trade credit from suppliers.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Prices
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Producer and consumer prices are generally reported as stable. 
Boston reports that manufacturing prices are flat to down and that 
retailers are feeling pressure to lower prices. The San Francisco 
district reports little upward pressure on prices, with the 
exception of lumber and health care. Atlanta reports that while most 
contacts report relatively stable input prices, a growing minority 
of factory contacts are reporting increasing material prices. 
Respondents in the Kansas City district also note stable material 
prices, but prices are expected to rise slightly over the next few 
months.
