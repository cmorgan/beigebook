          Reports from Federal Reserve Districts indicated 
              that overall economic activity expanded at a moderate pace in late 
              April and May. The tone was one of modest but uneven growth, with 
              some major sectors showing signs of improvement while others softened 
              or remained weak. Retail sales were flat in most Districts, and 
              auto sales were mixed. Activity in the services and manufacturing 
              sectors improved overall but varied across regions and segments. 
              Residential real estate markets generally remained robust while 
              weakness persisted in most commercial markets. Districts noted few 
              changes in lending markets. Labor markets remained slack in most 
              Districts, but several Districts reported higher demand for temporary 
              workers. Price pressures were in check for most goods and services, 
              but many Districts noted rising steel prices and continued increases 
              in energy and insurance costs.

           <br/>
           Most Districts reported that retail sales were similar to year-ago 
              levels. Richmond, Atlanta, St. Louis, and Minneapolis reported that 
              recent sales were flat on a year-over-year basis. According to New 
              York, Chicago, and Dallas, sales were sluggish. Sales in the Boston, 
              Philadelphia, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts were improved, 
              in contrast. Cleveland reported mixed results. Unseasonable weather 
              reportedly hampered sales in the New York, Chicago, St. Louis, and 
              Dallas Districts. Most Districts continued to report balanced inventories.

          Reports on automobile sales in late April and 
              May were uneven. Sales were robust in the Boston, Chicago, and San 
              Francisco Districts. Reports from Cleveland, Richmond, St. Louis, 
              Minneapolis, and Dallas were mixed. Philadelphia and Kansas City 
              said that sales were down on a year-over-year basis, although Philadelphia 
              noted that sales were at healthy levels. In the Atlanta and St. 
              Louis Districts, some dealers complained about lost sales because 
              potential buyers did not qualify for credit.

           <br/>
           The services sector posted modest growth. Business was up for financial, 
              legal, information technology, and trucking firms in the Philadelphia 
              District. Cleveland reported a significant increase in demand for 
              trucking and shipping services, and the demand for legal services 
              was strong in the New York and Dallas Districts. New York, Richmond, 
              and Atlanta said that computer-related service firms were experiencing 
              weak demand; San Francisco noted heavy discounting of software and 
              high-tech services. Boston, in contrast, reported some growth in 
              demand for software products and services, particularly for health 
              care-related software.

          Reports on the tourism and hospitality industry 
              generally continued to indicate an upward trend. Hotel occupancy 
              picked up slightly in the San Francisco District and remained steady 
              in the New York District. Richmond and Boston said that hotels reported 
              steady demand and were hiring additional staff; sources in South 
              Carolina said that business had "turned the corner" from September 
              11 effects. Atlanta and San Francisco reported strong forward bookings 
              for summer tourist destinations, and Florida theme parks were adding 
              to payrolls. Chicago noted that a major airline was experiencing 
              strong leisure travel but weak business travel. In the Cleveland 
              District, business conference attendance remained lower than last 
              year.

            Construction and Real Estate
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Residential real estate activity remained robust in most Districts. 
              Home sales improved in the New York, Atlanta, and St. Louis Districts 
              compared with the previous year, and Richmond said that sales were 
              up overall compared with the last Beige Book. Existing home sales 
              picked up in the Chicago District, but new home sales were not as 
              strong. San Francisco reported solid activity in most areas, while 
              Kansas City noted strong sales of lower-priced homes and weak sales 
              of high-end homes. Philadelphia reported high sales levels and accelerating 
              prices. Richmond also noted rising home prices. Dallas, in contrast, 
              said that builders reported a drop in sales and were offering concessions. 
              Single-family construction varied across Districts, with activity 
              up in the St. Louis, Minneapolis, and San Francisco Districts and 
              remaining solid in most of the Kansas City District. Kansas City 
              and Minneapolis noted slowing or weakness in the multifamily market, 
              but the Manhattan multifamily market strengthened, according to 
              New York.

         <p class="content">
          Most Districts continued to report weak commercial 
              real estate markets, with high vacancy rates and lower rental rates. 
              Boston, Atlanta, St. Louis, Dallas, and San Francisco characterized 
              commercial markets as weak. Commercial markets eased in the Philadelphia 
              District and declined in the Cleveland, Kansas City, and Minneapolis 
              Districts. New York reported that markets were stabilizing in the 
              New York City area. Chicago reported mixed results. Richmond noted 
              an increase in commercial activity, mainly in the office segment.

            Manufacturing

           <br/>
           Factory production, shipments, and orders were higher in most Districts, 
              but the gains were uneven across industries. Automakers in the Cleveland 
              District reported strong activity, and Chicago noted a surge in 
              heavy truck orders as customers sought to make purchases ahead of 
              EPA regulatory changes, scheduled to take effect October 1. Richmond 
              indicated strong growth in shipments and orders for textile products, 
              and St. Louis reported increased demand for a variety of non-durable 
              goods. In the Philadelphia District, producers of construction materials 
              continued to report robust demand. Dallas commented that refineries 
              were operating near capacity for most of April and May. According 
              to San Francisco, contacts indicated a pickup in new orders and 
              sales in the semiconductor industry, which allowed producers to 
              draw down inventories. More generally, inventories of finished goods 
              were flat or lower in most Districts, although Kansas City noted 
              that some plant managers were increasing inventories. Boston and 
              San Francisco said that orders were down considerably for suppliers 
              of aircraft components. According to Philadelphia, Atlanta, Dallas, 
              and San Francisco, demand for telecommunications equipment remained 
              weak.

           <br/>
           Demand for bank loans was little changed, with conditions generally 
              better on the consumer side than on the commercial side. Cleveland, 
              Atlanta, and Dallas reported robust consumer lending. Cleveland, 
              Richmond, Chicago, St. Louis, Kansas City, and Dallas said that 
              business lending was soft or sluggish. Chicago said that firms were 
              wary of borrowing to make large capital outlays. New York, in contrast, 
              reported sagging loan demand on the consumer side but rising demand 
              from commercial borrowers. Improvements in bank earnings, loan quality 
              and demand were noted at San Francisco District banks. New York 
              and St. Louis reported tighter or stable credit standards, while 
              Philadelphia and Atlanta noted that some lenders have become more 
              cautious in business lending. According to Cleveland and Atlanta, 
              reports on loan delinquencies ranged from no change to a slight 
              increase. Contacts in New York and Chicago reported that delinquency 
              rates were lower or stable, while St. Louis noted a rise in defaults. 
              Philadelphia reported that the outstanding loan volume has been 
              moving up somewhat in recent weeks.

           <br/>
           Labor market conditions improved marginally but remained slack overall. 
              As a consequence, reports cited little upward pressure on wages. 
              Labor market conditions were little changed in the Cleveland, Chicago, 
              Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts. Richmond and Dallas said 
              that labor market conditions were mixed, whereas New York reported 
              some improvement. Minneapolis noted that general labor market conditions 
              eased slightly. Temporary employment agencies experienced increased 
              demand in the Boston, Philadelphia, Richmond, and Atlanta Districts. 
              Dallas noted that demand for temps rose in the manufacturing sector 
              but declined in several service industries. Temporary worker demand 
              was flat in the Cleveland District. Kansas City and Minneapolis 
              noted an ongoing shortage of nurses, and skilled tradesmen were 
              in short supply in the Kansas City District.

          Price increases remained subdued overall, but 
              the prices of a few goods and services rose substantially. Most 
              Districts reported steel prices were sharply higher. Dallas said 
              that the prospect of further steel price increases had spurred strong 
              sales for fabricated metal products. Rising insurance costs were 
              noted as concerns in the Boston, Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis, 
              and San Francisco Districts. Boston, Richmond, and Dallas reported 
              higher prices for energy and petrochemical products. New York and 
              Dallas reported that manufacturers generally were not able to pass 
              along higher input costs.

              City, Minneapolis, Dallas, and San Francisco reported that a drought 
              was hurting crops and cattle in at least part of their Districts; 
              some crops in the Richmond District were stunted by a late frost. 
              Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, and Kansas City also noted problems 
              resulting from unseasonable weather conditions. Minneapolis, Kansas 
              City, and San Francisco reported concerns about low livestock prices, 
              while cattle ranchers in Texas expect to face higher costs because 
              all livestock leaving the state may have to be vaccinated against 
              bovine tuberculosis.

          Energy-related activities were up in the Minneapolis,

              months. Minneapolis noted expansions in the iron ore mining industry.
