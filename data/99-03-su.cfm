           <strong>

         <p>
          The districts reported some further gains in economic activity in 
January and February, despite weakness in agriculture and a few 
manufacturing industries. Consumer spending continued to display 
strength, aided by  post-holiday price discounting and mild weather 
in some regions. Motor vehicle sales increased, led by light trucks, 
and furniture sales benefited from robust home sales. Manufacturing 
activity expanded in most districts, although foreign competition 
and low energy prices depressed textile, apparel, and 
energy-related industries.
         </p>
         <p>
          Commercial real estate and construction activity, already at a high 
level, grew at a brisk pace in most districts.  Residential 
construction was strong in most regions. Several districts reported 
a pickup in business lending, and a few noted that lenders' 
standards were stable to slightly tighter. Agriculture continued to 
be plagued by  low farm commodity prices, and an increasing number 
of farmers were under financial stress. Labor markets  remained 
tight. Finding qualified workers has become more difficult in 
several districts, and reports of faster wage increases were more 
widespread than in recent months. Prices of most goods remained 
little changed, and  several districts said that businesses remain 
reluctant to press for price increases.
         </p>
         <p>
          <b>
           Consumer Spending
          </b>
          <br/>
          Retail sales remained strong in the first two months of the year, 
and most districts reported that activity was substantially higher 
than a year ago. Inventories were balanced and in line with future 
sales expectations. Boston, New York, Cleveland, Chicago, and 
Dallas experienced faster-than-expected sales growth, while in 
Atlanta, sales were flat or up only slightly from the prior year. In 
the Philadelphia, Richmond, Chicago, Kansas City, and San Francisco 
districts, substantial post-holiday price discounting helped move 
winter merchandise  and boost sales, while Cleveland reported strong 
sales despite unusually small discounts. Healthy housing  markets 
supported strong demand for furniture and home products in Boston, 
Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta,  Chicago, and Dallas. Apparel sales 
were lackluster in New York and Richmond but remained strong in 
Boston,  Atlanta, and Chicago.
         </p>
         <p>
          Automobile sales increased in many districts in January and 
February. Philadelphia, Cleveland, Chicago, Dallas,  and San 
Francisco noted that motor vehicle sales--especially 
of sport-utility vehicles and light trucks--strengthened compared to 
December. Auto sales were lagging in Kansas City and flat in 
Minneapolis.
         </p>
         <p>
          Two districts had upbeat reports on tourism. Resort activity was up 
from a year ago in the Atlanta District, while in Minneapolis skiing 
revenues were strong. In the Richmond District, mild weather damped 
revenues at ski areas but helped tourism in coastal regions. 
New York noted that their tourism boom had leveled off and that 
hotel occupancy rates had fallen.
         </p>
         <p>
          <b>
           Manufacturing
          </b>
          <br/>
          The tone of manufacturing improved in most districts, although some 
industries continued to be hampered by  foreign competition. Growth 
in overall manufacturing activity strengthened in the New York, 
Philadelphia, Richmond, St. Louis, Minneapolis, and San Francisco 
districts. In the Boston, Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, and  Dallas 
districts, manufacturing was described as mixed, while Kansas City 
said that its manufacturing sector  remained weak.
         </p>
         <p>
          Motor vehicle production moved higher in the Boston, Cleveland, 
Chicago, and San Francisco districts. In Cleveland and Chicago, 
heavy truck orders exceeded analysts' expectations in February and 
led some to raise their sales forecasts for 1999. The Boston 
and Richmond districts noted strength in the furniture industry, 
while  St. Louis characterized its furniture industry as mixed. 
Several districts noted that shipments of semiconductors and high-
tech equipment increased. Expectations for business conditions 
in coming months were mostly positive. Boston, for example, reported 
that most manufacturers' expectations were positive but cautious for 
1999. Producers in the Philadelphia and Richmond districts expected 
orders and output to increase over the next six months.
         </p>
         <p>
          <b>
           Construction and Real Estate
          </b>
          Residential real estate activity remained vigorous in nearly all 
districts. Increases in housing starts were reported in the New 
York, Cleveland, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, and San Francisco 
districts. Residential construction was particularly active 
in Ohio, where some of the activity was described as speculative. 
Also, residential construction was said to be running at a record 
pace in St. Louis, and in the Minneapolis District, reports of 
increased residential construction were widespread. In contrast, new 
home construction eased a bit in the Atlanta, Dallas, and parts of 
the San Francisco District.
         </p>
         <p>
          Contacts in the Chicago District indicated that existing home sales 
have slowed since December. Housing sales were described as brisk in 
the New York, Philadelphia, and Dallas districts. New home purchases 
were above the previous year's level in Kansas City and builders 
there were optimistic about the next few months. Home prices moved 
higher in the New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, and St. 
Louis districts.
         </p>
         <p>
          In the Cleveland, Richmond, Minneapolis, and Kansas City districts, 
construction costs increased in recent weeks. Drywall and insulation 
shortages, as well as tight markets for skilled labor, placed upward 
pressure on prices. In contrast, San Francisco reported that lower 
labor costs in Utah and sluggish activity in Oregon had slowed 
construction cost increases in those areas.
         </p>
         <p>
          Commercial real estate activity remained strong in most districts, 
although there were a few reports of slowing activity. Competition 
for commercial space intensified in the Carolinas. Rental rates rose 
in the New York and Philadelphia districts, and reached record high 
levels in the San Francisco Bay area. Chicago and Minneapolis noted 
faster growth in construction activity, particularly of public works 
projects. Boston reported an uptick in activity around Hartford, 
Connecticut, with several new construction projects planned. In 
contrast, Atlanta, Dallas, and San Francisco reported slowdowns in 
new construction, while activity in the Cleveland District was 
described as flat. Office leasing was said to be leveling off in 
Boston, and in the St. Louis District vacancy rates rose in central 
business districts.
         </p>
         <p>
          <b>
           Banking and Finance
          </b>
          <br/>
          Lenders were upbeat in most districts. Atlanta and San Francisco 
reported strong overall demand for loans, and New York and Kansas 
City said that loans or loan demand increased. Several districts 
noted strength in specific categories of lending: Chicago cited 
strong demand for consumer and business loans, while Dallas said 
that auto lending and home equity refinancing showed "signs of 
strength." Overall loan volumes were steady in Philadelphia and 
Richmond. Higher mortgage rates slowed the pace of lending in 
Richmond and caused a drop in loan originations and refinancing 
applications for some banks in the Chicago District. The only 
district reporting a decline in overall lending was St. Louis, where 
total loans at a group of large banks was said to be down 2.5 
percent since the beginning of the year.
         </p>
         <p>
          Reports on credit quality and delinquency rates were mixed. Chicago 
said that credit quality improved and New York reported lower 
delinquency rates for all types of loans. Cleveland, however, noted 
that many banks reported higher delinquency rates. In addition, 
automobile dealers in the Cleveland District expressed concerns 
about the credit worthiness of some new car buyers. San Francisco 
said that the only report of deteriorating credit quality was from 
the Oregon coast, where loan delinquencies rose.
         </p>
         <p>
          <b>
           Labor Markets, Wages, and Prices
          </b>
          <br/>
          Labor markets remained taut with higher employment levels reported 
in nearly all districts. Employers in the Chicago, Minneapolis, 
Kansas City, and Dallas districts continued to experience difficulty 
finding qualified workers. Markets for retail labor remained tight 
across much of the nation, especially in the New York and Kansas 
City districts, where finding even entry-level workers was said to 
be difficult. Cleveland also said that retail labor conditions 
remained tight, but somewhat less so than in December. Retailers in 
the Richmond District trimmed workers in an effort to control costs.
         </p>
         <p>
          Temporary employment firms faced strong demand for their services in 
January and February. Boston and Chicago indicated that more 
businesses had recently turned to temporary employment firms to find 
workers. Cleveland and Richmond reported that temporary help firms 
were unable to meet their clients' demand for workers, raising the 
probability of future wage increases. The demand for contingent 
workers was mixed in the Dallas District, where requests from 
telecommunications firms, call centers, and banks remained at high 
levels, although demand from manufacturing and oil companies 
slackened.
         </p>
         <p>
          Manufacturing employment was mixed across districts in January and 
February. St. Louis manufacturers increased their workforces, and 
plants in the Philadelphia District planned to add workers and 
lengthen the workweek in coming months. Boston and Richmond 
reported steady manufacturing employment, while declines were cited 
by New York, Cleveland, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco.
         </p>
         <p>
          The Boston, Cleveland, Richmond, Chicago, Minneapolis, Kansas City, 
and Dallas districts reported greater upward wage pressures in 
January and February. Generally stable wages were reported by New 
York, Atlanta, and San Francisco. Most districts indicated that 
higher wage costs were absorbed by businesses.
         </p>
         <p>
          Low commodity prices and a perceived lack of pricing power by firms 
helped keep prices stable during January and February. Boston, 
Philadelphia, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis, Kansas City, 
and San Francisco reported generally steady prices, while Dallas 
indicated that price declines outnumbered price increases in that 
district. Rising lumber and drywall prices were reported by 
Cleveland and Minneapolis, while insulation and sheetrock prices 
inched up in the Kansas City District. Escalating health care costs 
continued to plague employers in the Atlanta, Minneapolis, and San 
Francisco districts.
         </p>
         <p>
          <b>
           Agriculture and Natural Resources
          </b>
          <br/>
          The weather had mixed impacts on agricultural production across the 
districts, and low commodity prices affected both agricultural and 
energy producers. Respondents from Richmond and Minneapolis said 
that above-normal temperatures generally improved crop and pasture 
conditions and reduced the need for supplemental feeding of 
livestock in some areas. Richmond and Kansas City noted, however, 
that warm weather had accelerated crop development, which increased 
the potential for frost damage. San Francisco reported "severe 
damage" to its citrus crop from a late December freeze. 
Agricultural banks in several districts stated that weak commodity 
prices had caused financial hardship for some farmers. Lenders in 
the Chicago District experienced a drop off in agricultural loan 
repayment rates compared to a year ago, and some hog farmers in 
the Kansas City District liquidated herds earlier than normal. Both 
districts noted that credit standards for agricultural loans had 
recently been raised. Contacts in the Dallas District said that a 
greater number of producers had left the farming business recently. 
In the energy sector, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and San Francisco 
reported that falling oil prices were causing some oil and gas wells 
to be withdrawn from production.
