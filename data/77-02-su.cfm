           <strong>
            February 9, 1977
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p align="left">
           Weather dominated the news in most Districts' reports. Cold weather 
  drained natural gas supplies and resulted in widespread layoffs in 
  some Districts, especially Atlanta, Philadelphia, Cleveland, 
  Chicago, and New York and extensive crop damage in Florida. 
  Nevertheless, the overall opinion seems to be that the economy shows 
  signs of strengthening and losses in output and employment will be 
  made up later in the year. Retail sales were particularly strong in 
  several areas not affected by the weather, such as San Francisco and 
  Boston, and also held up in Chicago and St. Louis despite severe 
  weather. Housing activity shows signs of accelerating. Prices for 
  manufactured goods are likely to be under upward pressures because 
  of the high cost of alternate fuels and alternate transportation, 
  and prices for fruits and vegetables are also expected to 
  accelerate. Savings flows remain generally strong and rates paid on 
  deposits are easing in some Districts.
          </p>
          <p align="left">
           Natural gas and fuel shortages apparently have their greatest 
  effects on output and employment in Atlanta, Philadelphia, 
  Cleveland, Chicago, and New York. An estimated 250,000 to 335,000 
  layoffs have resulted from fuel shortages in the Atlanta District. 
  Approximately 175,000 workers were laid off in the Philadelphia 
  District as a result of curtailments of natural gas and weather-
  related problems. Cleveland estimates that about 110,000 
  manufacturing workers were laid off as of early February, 
  principally in steel, automotive, glass, and metal fabricating 
  plants. Chicago notes that the most serious impact has been on steel 
  plants in Indiana, where over 40,000 workers were laid off early in 
  February. Automotive assembly plants in Michigan had layoffs because 
  of parts shortages. Chicago and Cleveland said that many 
  manufacturers have switched to alternate fuels, but deliveries have 
  been slowed by frozen waterways and lack of carriers. As these 
  deliveries have improved, many laid off workers have been recalled. 
  New York also notes cutbacks in output and employment, especially in 
  Buffalo and Rochester.
          </p>
          <p align="left">
           Slight to moderate effects of fuel shortages were noted in Richmond 
  and St. Louis, but other Districts, including Boston, Minneapolis, 
  and Dallas, were relatively unaffected either because alternate fuel 
  supplies have been available or weather conditions have not been 
  abnormal.
          </p>
          <p align="left">
           Despite widespread effects of fuel shortages and abnormal 
  conditions, the tone of District reports still seems to indicate 
  that losses in output and employment will eventually be recovered 
  and economic activity will continue to strengthen. New York remarks 
  that "business economists viewed the decline in production and 
  employment as a temporary disruption," and Cleveland points out 
  economists who met at that Bank on February 3 expect the expansion 
  to continue through 1977 despite constraints on fuel supplies. The 
  latest surveys by the Philadelphia and Richmond Banks indicate that 
  respondents expect continued improvement in economic activity at 
  least through the first half of 1977.
          </p>
          <p align="left">
           Consumer spending has been notably strong in some Districts, but 
  fell sharply in some others especially in the last few weeks of the 
  cold weather period. Boston, Chicago, St. Louis, and San Francisco 
  note that retail sales in the last 2 months were strong; but New 
  York and Philadelphia comment that sales in the last 2 weeks of 
  January and early February fell sharply, apparently in response to 
  severe weather. Retailers, although optimistic, are concerned over 
  effects of high fuel bills on discretionary spending.
          </p>
          <p align="left">
           Construction activity, especially housing, appears to show signs of 
  accelerating. Substantial strength in housing starts is noted in 
  Dallas and San Francisco. Forecasts of housing starts in the Chicago 
  District have been increased because of the large volume of funds 
  available from savings and loan associations and life insurance 
  companies. Dallas remarks that one homebuilder plans to boost starts 
  by a fourth this year in Dallas, Ft. Worth, and Houston. Starts in 
  several areas of the San Francisco District have increased 30 to 50 
  percent from last year. Both Dallas and Atlanta report mobile home 
  sales have strengthened. Similarly, signs of revival in multi-family 
  construction are noted in the southwest and west coast areas. 
  Shortages of building materials, including lumber, brick, cement, 
  plastic pipe, wallboard, and insulation, may develop this year 
  according to Chicago and Dallas.
          </p>
          <p align="left">
           Adverse weather conditions in Atlanta, Minneapolis, and San 
  Francisco have caused extensive damage to crops and concern over 
  future prospects for agriculture in those Districts. Florida's 
  fruit, sugar cane, and vegetable crops, except celery and lettuce, 
  have been severely damaged by freezing weather. Citrus fruit losses 
  are estimated between 25 and 35 percent of the unharvested crop. 
  Last year's drought and lack of moisture caused considerable concern 
  to farmers and bankers in the Minneapolis District. Low farm 
  commodities prices and low production in drought-stricken areas are 
  cutting farm spending. The need for refinancing appears to have 
  increased, but bankers are concerned about the ability of farmers to 
  continue payments even on existing loans. Lack of rainfall in the 
  west is curtailing hydro-electric power output. According to San 
  Francisco, the Bonneville Power Administration has stopped the flow 
  of interruptible power to aluminum and chemical plants in the 
  northwest and plans for allocating water to farm and residential 
  areas are underway in most States. Agriculture prices will 
  apparently be under upward price pressures because of adverse 
  weather conditions. Sharp increases in prices for agricultural 
  commodities this year are expected by San Francisco, and Atlanta 
  points out that vegetable, citrus crops, and livestock prices are 
  likely to increase as a result of a severe freeze in Florida. 
  However, ample supplies of red meat and pork should hold down 
  increases in overall food prices, at least for the first half of 
  1977 according to Kansas City. Large beef supplies in the first half 
  are likely to be followed by smaller supplies and higher prices in 
  the second half of 1977. Upward price pressures on industrial 
  commodities are likely to intensify because of higher costs of 
  alternate fuel oil and higher costs of alternate modes of 
  transportation.
          </p>
          <p align="left">
           Business loan demand remains generally sluggish in Districts that 
  commented. However, a considerable pickup in credit demand from oil 
  distributors to finance inventories is noted in Philadelphia, and 
  Kansas City notes strong loan demand by coal mining and oil drilling 
  firms. Easing in rates paid on time and savings deposits and on 
  saving certificates has occurred in Dallas and St. Louis; but some 
  thrift institutions in Cleveland, which only last month reduced 
  rates on passbook savings accounts and on certificates, raised rates 
  because of loss of deposits.
