           Reports from the twelve Federal Reserve districts suggest that 
moderate growth in economic activity continued in early fall, 
although perhaps at a slower pace than at the time of the previous 
set of reports. The evidence of a possible slowing in demand mainly 
was from the reports on consumer spending, which suggested a pause 
in retail sales in some districts. However, a pickup in exports and 
strong domestic demand for certain types of business equipment led 
to stable or increased manufacturing activity in most districts, 
after the dropback earlier in the year. Although the summer rebound 
in residential construction was not generally augmented by 
additional gains, the slightly improved level of building activity 
appeared to be maintained in recent months. Some districts reported 
that nonresidential construction strengthened, and several districts 
noted a firming in commercial and industrial leasing activity. A few 
districts reported new manifestations of labor market tightness, but 
overall wage gains remained moderate, and reports of rapidly rising 
materials costs have lessened substantially.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Retail Trade
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Retail sales, on the whole, appeared to be soft in early fall. 
Several of the districts with preliminary reports on October sales--
Boston, Chicago, New York, and Philadelphia--noted some signs of 
weakened spending, although this partly was attributed to weather-
related sales volatility. Elsewhere, retail sales results generally 
were described as disappointing and below expectations. Retail 
inventories are somewhat heavy with fall merchandise in several 
districts, and some retailers have scaled back stocking plans to 
prevent a further runup. Apparel and other soft goods appear to have 
been the weakest sales areas. Reports on sales of autos and other 
big ticket items were mixed.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Manufacturing
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Many districts reported stable or increased manufacturing activity, 
after the dropback earlier in the year. Chicago, New York, 
Philadelphia, and Richmond noted generally rising manufacturing 
output. Dallas, Philadelphia, and San Francisco pointed to makers of 
semiconductors, computer products, and other electrical machinery as 
a major source of strength. Elsewhere--in Atlanta, Boston, 
Cleveland, and St. Louis--changes in manufacturing activity were 
mixed, as renewed strength in exports offset slowing domestic demand 
for some types of goods.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Real Estate and Construction
           </strong>
           <br/>
           On balance, residential building activity appears to have been 
little changed this fall, after the summer rebound. However, the 
pace of residential construction varied widely by geographic area. 
In Philadelphia and Richmond, residential construction was scaled 
back. Chicago and Minneapolis finished the peak building season at 
high levels, and parts of the San Francisco district reported 
increased residential construction. In Atlanta and Kansas City, 
multi-family construction strengthened recently, whereas Dallas 
reported a pickup in construction of single-family units. In many of 
the areas with increased residential construction, home sales also 
have improved lately, as buyers took advantage of lower mortgage 
interest rates.
          </p>
          <p>
           Some districts reported strengthening nonresidential construction. 
St. Louis and San Francisco suggested that there has been a general 
increase in nonresidential building activity. Atlanta and Richmond 
pointed to gains in construction of structures for commercial use, 
whereas Minneapolis noted increased construction of office and 
warehouse space. Moreover, demand for nonresidential space picked up 
in Atlanta, Dallas, Richmond, St. Louis, and parts of the San 
Francisco district. In contrast, office and commercial real estate 
markets were sluggish in Philadelphia, Boston, and New York.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Services
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Some districts mentioned increased activity in selected service-
producing industries. Demand for business services increased in some 
districts; Dallas and San Francisco noted increased demand, for 
legal or financial advice on business transactions, and Boston 
mentioned a pickup in outsourcing of personnel department functions 
to temporary help agencies. Atlanta, Boston, Minneapolis, and San 
Francisco noted gains in tourism.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Financial Institutions
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Loan demand reportedly increased in early fall in most districts. 
Philadelphia, Cleveland, Atlanta, and San Francisco singled out 
business lending as the primary source of increased loan volumes. 
New York found that demand for consumer loans also increased in the 
last two months.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Agriculture and Natural Resources
           </strong>
           <br/>
           The recent harvests of many major crops were marked by lower than 
average yields and increases in prices. St. Louis, Kansas City, and 
other districts noted that yields of corn and soybeans were below 
average, and prices increased in recent months. Richmond, St. Louis, 
and Dallas also noted that adverse weather and insect problems hurt 
the cotton crop. In the San Francisco district, yields for selected 
crops were low too, but some agricultural producers there recently 
have benefited from increased exports of apples and other 
agricultural commodities.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Wages and Prices
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Reports of rapidly rising materials costs have lessened, and several 
districts noted a partial reversal of earlier commodity price run-
ups. Boston mentioned softening of prices of paper packaging 
materials, metals, and plastics. Cleveland reported a drop in steel 
prices, after earlier increases. Some finished manufactured goods 
prices still are under pressure from the earlier runup in costs of 
intermediate materials. However, reports from several districts 
suggest that retail goods prices were little changed, and in some 
cases, discounting this fall was heavier than last year.
          </p>
          <p>
           A few districts reported new manifestations of labor market 
tightness, but overall wage gains apparently remained moderate. The 
report from the Minnesota district noted that, as it has become 
harder to attract and keep good workers in that area, some firms 
have expanded employee eligibility for benefits. Many districts 
continued to emphasize that skilled workers--particularly 
construction workers in fast-growing states and employees in high 
technology industries--have been commanding larger than average wage 
gains. In this report, Cleveland also noted that the movement of 
workers from less-skilled jobs into skilled positions is increasing 
training costs of employers and pushing up wages for less-skilled 
workers, who reportedly also are in short supply in many parts of 
that District. In Richmond and Chicago, salaries of workers at 
temporary help supply agencies were said to have increased 
particularly fast. Reports from San Francisco suggested that other 
types of workers are focusing more on job security than on wages, 
restraining the overall pace of increase in labor compensation 
rates.
