          Reports from the twelve Federal Reserve Districts suggest economic 
activity generally is continuing to expand at about the same pace as 
in recent months. Retail sales in most districts have improved, with 
nearly all districts reporting strong sales early in the holiday 
season. Manufacturing activity is increasing further in most 
districts, especially in durable goods industries, and the service 
sector is continuing to show strength. While single-family 
homebuilding continues to slow across most districts, commercial 
real estate markets and nonresidential construction have picked up 
in many districts. Loan demand is up in most districts, led by 
consumer loans and commercial and industrial lending. Farmers have 
harvested large crops in most parts of the nation but face generally 
low prices, as do cattle and hog producers. Energy activity in 
regions producing oil and natural gas has picked up somewhat. Prices 
of raw and intermediate materials continue to advance, with reports 
of some increases being passed through to final product prices. 
Labor markets in most districts have tightened further and more 
districts are reporting increasing wages in selected occupations.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Retail
          </strong>
          <br/>
          Retail sales have strengthened in most districts. While sales 
reports for October and early November were mixed due to 
unseasonably warm weather in some regions, Thanksgiving weekend 
sales were robust and year-over-year sales during the holiday season 
generally are expected to be strong. Retailers in the Boston 
district are the least optimistic, expecting moderate holiday sales 
growth. Retailers in the Chicago, St. Louis, and Kansas City 
districts report strong activity recently and high expectations for 
holiday sales.
         </p>
         <p>
          A wide range of merchandise apparently has been selling well, with 
some regional variation. Retailers in the New York, Philadelphia, 
Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, and Kansas City districts report either 
recently improving sales of apparel or expectations of improving 
sales during the holidays. In some of these districts the 
improvement is a rebound from soft sales of seasonal apparel during 
warm-weather spells in October. Furniture in the Atlanta, Cleveland, 
and Kansas City districts has been selling well. Seasonal items such 
as snowblowers and car batteries have been selling well in the 
Chicago district. Retailers in the Philadelphia and Richmond 
districts expect strong sales of consumer electronic goods during 
the holidays. Auto sales have held up well in most regions, except 
where dealers continue to have difficulties obtaining popular 
models.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Manufacturing
          </strong>
          <br/>
          Manufacturing activity continues to increase in almost all regions. 
Many districts report growing shipments and high levels of capacity 
use. One exception is the Richmond district, where indicators of 
factory activity remained unchanged in October from September. 
Nonetheless, manufacturers there expect shipments and employment 
levels to increase in the months ahead.
         </p>
         <p>
          Durable goods industries over the past month have been the strongest 
performers. The strongest industries in the Boston district were 
consumer durables and new types of computer equipment. The 
electronic components industry has been strong in the Dallas and San 
Francisco districts. Factory activity in the Philadelphia and 
Cleveland districts has been boosted by increased production of 
durable goods such as steel, other metal products, and machinery. 
The Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, and Minneapolis 
districts report strength in the production of automobiles and 
related products. While the Atlanta and Dallas districts note some 
slowing of orders for building materials, this industry remains 
robust in the San Francisco, Boston, Chicago, St. Louis, and 
Minneapolis districts.
         </p>
         <p>
          Examples of weak industries are much less common. The aerospace 
industry continues to damp manufacturing gains in the Boston and San 
Francisco districts. And, the apparel industry remains weak in the 
Boston, Philadelphia, and Atlanta districts.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Services
          </strong>
          <br/>
          Service activity continues to expand in all districts that report on 
this sector. Business services such as accounting, legal, computer, 
and temporary-help firms have seen their business grow in the 
Chicago, Dallas, and San Francisco districts. Temporary-help firms 
in the Chicago district report labor shortages across a wide range 
of service businesses. Tourism is generally operating at high levels 
of capacity and expanding in the Atlanta and San Francisco 
districts. Even the sluggish Florida tourism market appears to be 
improving. The San Francisco district, however, reports that the 
health care industry has been restrained by uncertainty about 
industry restructuring.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Construction and Real Estate
          </strong>
          <br/>
          Single-family homebuilding continues to cool across most districts. 
The Richmond, Atlanta, Kansas City, and San Francisco districts 
report decreases in homebuilding or sales activity. Homebuilding is 
mixed across parts of the St. Louis district and appears to be 
leveling off in the New York and Minneapolis districts. Homebuilding 
in the Dallas district remains strong, although builders expressed 
concern about higher interest rates. Multifamily housing markets 
have tightened in the Atlanta and St. Louis districts.
         </p>
         <p>
          Commercial real estate markets have picked up in many districts. The 
Boston, New York, Atlanta, St. Louis, Minneapolis, and Dallas 
districts all report robust commercial real estate activity with a 
surge in sales and construction in most markets. In the Richmond 
district, activity was steady but commercial vacancy rates declined. 
In the New York, Atlanta, and Dallas districts, commercial real 
estate activity has been boosted by tightening markets for office 
space. Retail and industrial leasing was cited as an additional 
factor contributing to the strength in the Atlanta and Dallas 
districts.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Banking and Finance
          </strong>
          <br/>
          Loan demand is up across most districts. Commercial and industrial 
loan demand has been rising in most districts, although the New York 
and Richmond districts are notable exceptions. Consumer lending 
continues to grow in many regions, led by new automobile loans. 
However, the Atlanta district reports steady overall consumer 
lending with a decline in auto loans, and the Richmond district 
reports a sharp drop in consumer lending. Residential mortgage 
lending and refinancing activity remained flat or declined in many 
districts. Lenders in several districts report intensifying 
competition, which has reduced interest rate margins. The Boston 
district notes an outflow from bond funds, although employment 
levels at asset management rums in the region remain stable.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Agriculture and Resource-related Industries
          </strong>
          <br/>
          The fall harvest of most crops is complete except in parts of the 
Richmond and Dallas districts where wet weather slowed the harvest. 
Grain crops are reported to be large across most regions and are 
pushing prices to low levels. The Minneapolis and Kansas City 
districts report less favorable conditions for livestock producers 
due to low prices for cattle and hogs. The San Francisco district 
reports some improvement in agricultural conditions due to 
relatively strong prices for wheat and cotton and an uptick in 
prices of fresh fruit.
         </p>
         <p>
          The Dallas, Kansas City, and Minneapolis districts report stronger 
energy activity, despite weak oil and natural gas prices. In the 
Minneapolis district, mining and forestry industries continue to 
boost output in response to strong demand.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Prices and Wages
          </strong>
          <br/>
          Most districts continue to report rising prices of raw and 
intermediate materials, especially paper products, plastics, 
chemicals, steel, and building materials. Evidence of increasing 
prices of finished goods remains much less widespread. The Boston, 
Philadelphia, and Richmond districts report rising prices of 
finished goods. In the San Francisco district, one large grocery 
chain reports pressures on prices from higher food-packaging costs. 
In the Cleveland district, furniture and petrochemical manufacturers 
have been pressing for price increases, but competition at the 
retail level continues to keep those prices in check. A recent 
survey of business people in the Minneapolis district shows 
heightened expectations that rising business costs will be passed 
along to consumers. In the Dallas district, retail prices continue 
to fall.
         </p>
         <p>
          Most districts report further tightening of labor markets, but the 
tightening remains confined to certain sectors. In the Cleveland 
district, labor shortages are limited to specific technical 
occupations. Markets for construction workers have been tighter in 
the Chicago, St. Louis, and Kansas City districts. In the Atlanta, 
Minneapolis and St. Louis districts, retail and food service firms 
report difficulty in hiring temporary workers for the holiday season 
due to tight labor markets. In the Dallas district, labor market 
tightness has surfaced in technical and professional fields.
         </p>
         <p>
          Labor market tightness has led to rising wages in more districts 
than reported in the last Beigebook. Districts reporting evidence of 
rising wages include Boston, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, 
Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas. Wage increases have generally 
been confined to skilled construction and industrial occupations and 
entry-level service and retail occupations. In the Kansas City 
district, only a few contacts report increased wages, and those 
increases were limited to skilled construction workers such as 
carpenters. The Dallas district reports only scattered evidence of 
wage increases, mostly in temporary-help services, trucking, 
accounting, and communications. In the Richmond district, wages 
increased at service-producing firms.
