          <strong>
           April 12, 1977
          </strong>
         </p>
         <p align="left">
          The recovery has been solidly reestablished, according to this 
month's district reports. Manufacturing activity has increased, 
retail sales are generally good, inventories appear to be at 
satisfactory levels and there are signs that capital spending is 
picking up. Deposit inflows continue to be strong, particularly for 
savings accounts. Loan demand seems to be up overall, but there is 
considerable variation in the reports on commercial loans. Recent 
rainfall has eased problems in the agricultural sector, but several 
districts mention that this area remains a trouble spot. Farmers are 
caught in a profits squeeze as costs, often drought related, are 
rising faster than prices. The one rather negative element in this 
generally favorable picture comes from reports of widespread price 
increases.
         </p>
         <p align="left">
          <span class="content">
           Consumer spending continues to be strong. Almost all districts 
  observed that retail sales are in an upward trend. Large ticket 
  items such as appliances and furniture were singled out as moving 
  particularly well by several Banks. (Boston, Richmond, St. Louis and 
  Minneapolis). Sales of automobiles were reported to be healthy by 
  Cleveland and Minneapolis, although in New York's district they are 
  lagging last year. All three Banks observed that standard and 
  intermediate size cars are in much greater demand than compacts. 
  When mentioned, inventories were said to be within desired limits. 
  Boston expressed concern that the tax rebate might lead to an 
  excessive inventory buildup as a result of temporarily higher sales.
          </span>
         </p>
         <p align="left">
          <span class="content">
           Manufacturing output and employment have picked up. Surveys by 
  Philadelphia, Richmond and Chicago indicated that new orders and 
  shipments are higher for many manufacturers. In both Philadelphia 
  and Richmond this improvement has caused increases in both 
  employment and the workweek. Cleveland, St. Louis and Minneapolis 
  also expressed optimism about business prospects. Among the 
  industries which were observed to have made significant gains in 
  recent months were primary metals, especially steel, textiles and 
  chemicals. Manufacturers of apparel and furniture were reported to 
  be doing well in some districts but not in others.
          </span>
         </p>
         <p align="left">
          <span class="content">
           The outlook for capital spending remains confused but there are 
  signs of an improvement. Producers of capital goods, particularly 
  small items, are experiencing increased interest in their products, 
  but there seems a general reluctance to undertake any large-scale 
  expansions. Increases in the demand for component capital goods like 
  bearings, castings and engines were reported by Boston, Cleveland, 
  Chicago and St. Louis. New York and Chicago observed that steel 
  sales were strengthening. Boston and San Francisco reported that 
  sales of aircraft and aircraft equipment were expected to improve; 
  and Cleveland and Chicago noted a strengthening in orders for 
  equipment used by the lumber industry. St. Louis indicated that 
  sales of construction equipment have increased but Cleveland 
  commented that these were still weak in its district. Despite these 
  indications that capital spending is picking up, several Banks 
  expressed dissatisfaction with the level of investment in their 
  districts. Boston and Richmond noted that there was little interest 
  in their regions in expanding capacity, New York reported that 
  capital spending was recovering slowly. Businessmen in its district 
  are said to feel strongly that investment is being discouraged by 
  government regulations. Environmental regulations were singled out. 
  This view was echoed by Chicago and St. Louis: while capital 
  spending is picking up, government regulations are hindering it. 
  Similar sentiments were expressed by Kansas City. On the more 
  positive side, approximately 40 percent of the firms responding to 
  Philadelphia's survey plan increased capital spending. Kansas City 
  reported that investment in the energy field has been strong and 
  will increase if there is a shift from natural gas to coal. 
  According to Dallas, oil drilling activity is continuing to rise and 
  the demand for oil field equipment is climbing steadily.

         <p align="left">
          <span class="content">
           Recent rains have relieved drought conditions in the west, but 
  several districts remain very concerned about low crop prices and 
  drought-induced cost increases. Chicago and St. Louis reported that 
  soil moisture conditions are considerably improved in their 
  districts and planting is proceeding normally. Minneapolis, Kansas 
  City, Dallas and San Francisco, on the other hand, reported that 
  while drought conditions have been alleviated considerably more 
  moisture is needed. All are concerned about depressed product 
  prices, particularly for wheat and cattle. These prices in 
  combination with rising costs have reduced farm income and except in 
  San Francisco's district have resulted in heavy borrowing at rural 
  banks.
          </span>
         </p>
         <p align="left">
          <span class="content">
           Financial developments seem generally consistent with other sectors 
  of the economy. Loan demand appears to have increased with real 
  estate and consumer loans accounting for most of the gain. Richmond, 
  Kansas City and San Francisco noted increases in commercial loan 
  demand; Boston, Philadelphia and St. Louis observed that it was flat 
  or varied throughout the district and Dallas reported a decrease. As 
  mentioned above, agricultural loans have increased in parts of the 
  west. Philadelphia reported that banks are receiving inquiries about 
  fixed rate loans and that one is offering high quality customers 
  loans at 8 percent with an outside maturity of five years and no 
  balance requirement. Kansas City noted that in Oklahoma a number of 
  banks had raised their local prime lending rate from 6 3/4 to 7 
  percent because of a strong demand for energy-related loans. Deposit 
  inflows to savings accounts and savings and loan associations are 
  said to be strong, although they have slowed recently in St. Louis 
  and Minneapolis.
          </span>

         <p align="left">
          <span class="content">
           The ominous note in this month's reports is the widespread price 
  increases observed in several districts. All the eastern banks—Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond and Atlanta—noted that manufacturing prices are increasing. Over half of the 
  respondents to Philadelphia's survey reported higher materials 
  prices. Price increases in metals appear to be holding according to 
  Boston and Cleveland, although Cleveland also noted that producers 
  of stainless steel withdrew increases announced earlier this month. 
  Concerns about inflation were apparently quite common among 
  respondents for New York and Boston, although the academic 
  economists consulted by Boston believe that recent spurts in prices 
  are temporary and that the underlying inflation rate is still between 5 and 6 percent.
