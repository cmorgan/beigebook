           </strong>

         </center>
         <p>
          All district economies continue to show overall strength, but a few 
have noted some recent moderation in their rates of growth. Retail 
sales are generally up in most districts, exceeding retailers' 
expectations in many of them. Auto sales, however, are generally 
down, although demand for pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles 
remains high. Industrial activity is on the rise in most parts of 
the country, with orders and production up. Most districts, though, 
are experiencing a decline in exports to Asia. Continuing the theme 
of recent reports, the demand for labor remains strong, with nearly 
all districts reporting shortages of workers at the entry level and 
in certain skilled categories. Widespread labor market tightness 
appears to have increased the degree of wage pressures compared with 
recent reports. Pressures on product prices remain eerily calm, as 
domestic competition, productivity gains and the Asian situation 
help to constrain production costs. Residential housing markets, 
buoyed by low interest rates and mild weather in many districts, are 
unseasonably hardy. Commercial real estate markets are healthy 
across districts. Loan demand, especially for residential mortgages, 
remains strong in most districts. Agricultural conditions are mixed, 
with some districts reporting that an abundance of precipitation has 
harmed crop prospects and delayed field preparation activities.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Consumer Spending
          </strong>
          <br/>
          Most districts report that January and February sales are up from 
one year ago. The Boston, Chicago, Cleveland, Dallas, New York and 
Richmond districts report that sales have generally exceeded 
retailers' expectations; in the Atlanta and St. Louis districts, 
sales have generally met expectations. Almost all districts report 
that unseasonably mild winter weather has helped boost sales of 
items in many categories, especially home improvement products, 
furniture and building materials. Sales of winter clothes, however, 
have suffered in most parts of the country. The New York district 
notes that contacts experiencing weak retail sales have usually 
cited mild weather as a cause. The Atlanta, Chicago, Cleveland, New 
York and Richmond districts report strong sales of spring clothes, 
particularly for women; the Boston and San Francisco districts note 
that apparel sales are down. The San Francisco district adds that 
department store sales in Southern California are also down. Most 
districts report that retailers' inventories are at desired levels, 
although some contacts in the Kansas City and St. Louis districts 
report that inventories are too high.
         </p>
         <p>
          Auto sales in most districts are down from one year ago. While sales 
of pickup trucks, sport utility vehicles and minivans remain strong, 
sales of passenger cars are either flat or down. The Richmond 
district reports, though, that sales of new and used vehicles have 
exceeded expectations. The Dallas district notes that vehicle sales 
surged in January, before slowing somewhat in February. Almost all 
districts report that vehicle inventories are too high, although 
contacts in the Kansas City district are satisfied with their 
stocks. Contacts in most districts expect some strengthening in 
sales this spring.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Manufacturing
          </strong>
          <br/>
          Almost all districts report steady or increasing growth in 
industrial activity, although the Dallas district notes a slight 
weakening in growth. The Chicago district reports that activity is 
robust, with nearly every sector operating near capacity, while 
Kansas City district contacts report that current operations are at 
moderately high levels of capacity utilization and expanding. The 
Cleveland district notes that, although production is up at most 
surveyed firms, the number reporting a slowing in production has 
risen. The Richmond district describes a resurgence of activity, 
with sharp rebounds in orders and shipments. The Chicago, Cleveland, 
Minneapolis, New York, Philadelphia, St. Louis and San Francisco 
districts also report hikes in new orders, while the Kansas City 
district has seen a mild decline.
         </p>
         <p>
          Makers of building materials and related products generally report 
continued brisk or rebounding sales due to strength in construction 
markets. The Dallas district, however, notes that sales of 
construction materials are down because of a wetter than usual 
February. Aircraft and heavy truck parts, primary and fabricated 
metals, and steel production are reportedly strong in the Boston, 
Chicago, Cleveland, Minneapolis, St. Louis and San Francisco 
districts. Demand for business services, particularly real estate 
services, and telecommunications services is up in the Richmond and 
San Francisco districts. Contacts in the Dallas district, though, 
report that sales of telecommunications equipment are essentially 
flat.
         </p>
         <p>
          The apparel industry is in decline in almost all districts. Plant 
closings, falling sales and declining orders are common, reflecting 
both increased import penetration and a weakening of export demand. 
Just about every district reports that exports of many goods to Asia 
are dropping. The Richmond district, however, notes that activity in 
the district, except in the textiles industry, has not been affected 
by the Asian situation. The Boston district adds that the strong 
dollar has been hurting exports to all parts of the world, not just 
to Asia.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Labor Markets
          </strong>
          <br/>
          The tone of this report is largely unchanged from that of recent 
reports: Taut labor markets continue to hamper business activity in 
a variety of ways. In general, the apparent imbalance between the 
demand and available supply of workers remains the dominant theme, 
with the majority of district reports suggesting that the supply of 
entry-level and skilled workers-most often in technology-related 
fields, but also in construction and certain skilled craft 
positions-appears to be insufficient to meet existing production 
schedules. In the St Louis district, for instance, contacts note 
that UPS is concerned it will not be able to find enough workers to 
staff a major expansion.
         </p>
         <p>
          Firms have used a variety of methods to ameliorate these shortages. 
For example, in the Boston and Cleveland districts, firms are hiring 
temporary workers and outsourcing production more often, while in 
the Atlanta, Chicago and Kansas City districts, firms are resorting 
to worker training programs and various incentive or award programs.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Wages and Prices
          </strong>
          <br/>
          With labor markets stretched to the limit in many areas, there have 
been reports of rather large wage increases-although this is by no 
means consistent across all districts. In the Boston district, 
vigorous demand at temporary employment agencies has produced wage 
increases of up to 15 percent; wage increases in the retail sector 
are running 4 to 6 percent higher than the previous year, while wage 
increases in manufacturing are running at 3 to 5 percent. Wage gains 
appear to be more measured elsewhere in the country. The Cleveland 
district reports wage gains of 3 percent, while the Minneapolis and 
San Francisco districts report wage increases of anywhere from 0 to 
4 percent. The Atlanta and Richmond districts report somewhat faster 
wage growth in the retail sector, but note that overall wage gains 
are modest to subdued, which is similar to the Chicago and Kansas 
City district reports.
         </p>
         <p>
          Price pressures appear to be less pressing than wage pressures, 
according to most district reports. Manufacturing raw materials 
costs have reportedly increased little, if at all, in the Boston, 
Chicago, Cleveland, New York and Philadelphia districts. At the same 
time, nonmanufacturing firms in the New York district, as well as 
manufacturing firms in the Kansas City and St. Louis districts, note 
higher input prices. In addition, a few districts continue to report 
that competitive pressures and productivity gains have worked to 
offset higher materials prices and to limit product price increases.
Although a few firms in the Chicago district have attempted to raise 
their selling prices, these efforts have not been entirely 
successful.
         </p>
         <p>
          The evolving Asian situation has had some depressing effect on 
prices, according to most district reports. The Dallas district 
reports that Asian currency movements against the U.S. dollar have 
caused widespread declines in the prices of commodities, computer 
components and petrochemical products. In the Atlanta district, some 
import prices have fallen, although not among importers with
fixed contracts. Meanwhile, retailers in the New York district 
report that no significant price declines in consumer goods have 
occurred.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Construction and Real Estate
          </strong>
          <br/>
          Every district reports strong residential housing market conditions. 
New home construction is described as unseasonably brisk in several 
districts, including Boston, Chicago, Cleveland, New York and St. 
Louis. Mild winter weather, high consumer confidence and low 
interest rates are credited with much of this strength. However, in 
several districts, such as Atlanta, Dallas, and Richmond,
otherwise robust activity is being hampered by wet weather. Sales of 
new and existing homes are reportedly strong in most districts, and 
modest price appreciation is noted by many districts.
         </p>
         <p>
          Commercial real estate markets are uniformly described as strong by 
reporting districts. Contacts in a number of districts are reporting 
declining vacancy rates, rising rental rates and increasing 
speculative construction. The commercial real estate market has 
"picked up dramatically" in the Richmond
district, with "floods of tenants looking for space." Nonresidential 
construction and prices are up in California, while the Dallas 
district reports a sharp increase in land prices. Contacts in 
several other districts, however, see signs of an impending slowdown 
and are worried about the pace of
speculative building.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Banking and Finance
          </strong>
          <br/>
          Most districts report moderate to vigorous demand for bank loans. 
Contacts in the Chicago, Cleveland, Dallas, Minneapolis, 
Philadelphia and San Francisco districts indicate that loan 
competition, especially on the commercial side, is stiff, although 
there are concerns in some districts that this competition could 
compromise credit standards. Mortgage lending, especially 
refinancings, is
reportedly strong in the Atlanta, Chicago, Cleveland, Dallas, Kansas 
City, New York, Philadelphia, Richmond and St. Louis districts. 
Contacts in the Atlanta and Chicago districts report robust consumer 
loan demand, while contacts in the Cleveland, Dallas, Philadelphia 
and St. Louis districts note some softening. A reduction in consumer 
loan delinquencies is reported in the Chicago and New
York districts. The Chicago district notes that credit card 
repayments are up and personal bankruptcies are declining.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Agriculture and Natural Resources
          </strong>
          <br/>
          Agricultural conditions vary widely across districts. The deluge of 
rain that hit California has damaged crops. Near-record 
precipitation has reportedly worsened the condition of the winter 
wheat crop in the Richmond district rather significantly. In the 
Kansas City district, however, the winter wheat crop appears to be 
in good shape. Although rains have delayed field activities in the 
Dallas and Minneapolis districts, overall conditions are reportedly 
good in those areas. Contacts in the Richmond district are worried 
that a late frost may harm the apple and peach crops. The Chicago 
district reports that corn exports have weakened markedly-not solely 
because of Asia-although the soybean export picture is somewhat 
brighter. In the St. Louis district, cotton exports to Asia, while 
still expected to wane, are not declining as much as many had 
expected since sales to other markets, such as Mexico, have picked 
up. The San Francisco district reports a similar situation for beef 
and pork exports. Lower cattle and hog prices are hurting the profit 
margins of producers in the Chicago, Minneapolis and Kansas City 
districts.
         </p>
         <p>
          The unseasonably warm winter weather has affected the energy extraction industries 
              to varying degrees. The Dallas and Minneapolis districts report 
              increased activity, while energy output increases have begun to 
              decline in the Kansas City district. Solid demand for steel continues 
              to bolster iron ore output in the Minneapolis district.
