           Business conditions improved in recent weeks for most regions of the 
country although weakness persists in some areas. Chicago, New York, 
Philadelphia, Minneapolis, and Boston report moderate economic 
expansion while Atlanta and San Francisco note brisk growth. 
Cleveland and St. Louis, in contrast, indicate weakening business 
activity.
          </p>
          <p>
           A resurgence in industrial activity has boosted many regional 
economies recently. Orders and production for electronic equipment, 
lumber, steel and textiles are increasing. Contracting domestic auto 
production, however, is blunting economic expansion in some areas. 
Construction activity is generally mixed; residential building has 
slowed in most regions, but commercial construction continues to 
grow, especially the non-building component. Consumer spending has 
been moderate, and retailers are cautious but positive about the 
outlook for fall sales. Several Districts report moderate 
merchandise price increases. Auto sales have been stimulated by 
manufacturers' incentives. Favorable crop conditions have led to 
greater-than-average yields in some regions, and farm credit 
problems are declining.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Industry
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Most Districts report improvement in industrial activity and point 
to continued expansion, at least for the near term. Factory orders, 
production, and shipments are generally above June-July levels and 
are trending upward. Inventories are for the most part at desired 
levels. Although input costs are expected to rise modestly, most 
producers do not plan to increase prices at the present time.
          </p>
          <p>
           Chicago notes that demand for steel is strong. Cleveland reports 
that firm prices have helped specialty steels, and Atlanta sees 
increasing activity for small steel producers. Boston reports 
increased demand for computer equipment, and San Francisco notes 
that orders and shipments are strong for electronic equipment 
producers.
          </p>
          <p>
           Philadelphia, Richmond, and Atlanta report increasing tightness in 
certain labor markets. Philadelphia notes that housing construction 
has slowed because of a lack of skilled carpenters, while Atlanta 
reports that carpet shipments are being delayed because producers 
have not been able to hire enough workers to keep up with orders. 
Minneapolis bank directors are concerned that tight labor markets 
may deter firms from locating in parts of the region. Although total 
manufacturing employment continues to decline in St. Louis, textile 
plants are operating near capacity; apparel orders are growing, as 
they are in Atlanta and Dallas. Less positively, Chicago and 
Cleveland suggest that weak domestic auto sales could result in 
further production cuts and layoffs in assembly plants in their 
regions.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Consumer Spending
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Retail activity in July and August was up moderately compared both 
to previous months' and year-ago levels in Boston, New York, 
Cleveland, Atlanta, and Kansas City; sales growth was somewhat 
lackluster in other Districts. Boston reported that fine summer 
weather boosted sales of seasonal items, and Cleveland, Atlanta, and 
San Francisco noted that soft goods sales were outperforming hard 
goods sales. A pick-up in appliance sales in Dallas, following a 
prolonged period of weakness, is attributed to a rise in first-time 
home purchases; sales of big-ticket items accelerated in mid-August 
in Richmond. Philadelphia and Chicago report that the late Labor Day 
this year is delaying back-to-school purchases, while sales of these 
items are strong in Atlanta, where school starts early. Hardly any 
Districts reported unusual imbalances in inventory levels. Retailers 
typically are reported to be "cautious or moderately optimistic" 
about the sales outlook for this fall compared to fall 1986.
          </p>
          <p>
           Boston, Cleveland, and Richmond noted moderately rising prices or 
expectations of moderate price hikes ahead. In Boston, prices are 
expected to rise significantly more by next spring because of 
imports; prices of electronics and apparel items are already rising 
across the nation because of import quotas and the failing dollar. 
The tight New England labor market is making it difficult for 
retailers to attract and retain employees.
          </p>
          <p>
           Manufacturers' financing and rebate incentives apparently have 
sparked auto sales and reduced inventory levels to more manageable 
levels although Chicago received reports that consumer response has 
been restrained. The outlook for sales apparently has generated 
dealer concern in much of the country.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Construction
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Construction activity is mixed across the country. Residential 
construction is slowing in a majority of Districts although 
conditions vary within many areas. While single-family construction 
is generally increasing, Chicago, Kansas City, and San Francisco 
mention a continuing decline in multifamily construction. Sales of 
existing homes soared above last year's levels in Atlanta. Kansas 
City and upstate New York also report an active residential market.
          </p>
          <p>
           Commercial construction continues to show a mixed pattern of 
strength and weakness, but it remains relatively strong. Non-
building construction is strengthening in Dallas, and Philadelphia 
notes that recent and prospective completions of major highway links 
in the suburbs will boost all types of commercial real estate in 
these areas.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Financial Services
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Loan growth in the nation's larger commercial banks is slowing. 
Philadelphia, Cleveland, and Atlanta report a slackening in 
commercial and industrial lending, but Philadelphia expects business 
lending to Increase moderately over the next few months.
          </p>
          <p>
           This uptick may be enhanced by improving conditions for the region's 
manufacturers. Passbook savings account balances are rowing rapidly 
in several western locations. Dallas notes a further slowing of 
deposit growth at both banks and thrift institutions. An increasing 
rate of decline In large time deposits is being offset partially by 
increases in small time deposits.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Agriculture, Forestry, and Mining
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Livestock producers are experiencing more favorable returns with St. 
Louis, Minneapolis, and Dallas reporting a profitable year as the 
result of lower feeding costs and higher product prices. Crop 
conditions have been favorable in most Districts this growing 
season; Atlanta, St. Louis, Minneapolis, and Kansas City expect 
above-average yields. Excessive heat and dry weather have damaged 
crops in the Richmond District.
          </p>
          <p>
           St. Louis notes that the volume of farm loans outstanding in their 
District is down over 15 percent from last year. Farm loan 
delinquencies and losses at agricultural banks have also dropped. 
Dallas notes that farm credit problems are diminishing in the 
Eleventh District as well.
          </p>
          <p>
           More volatile crude oil prices have characterized the petroleum 
industry in recent weeks, but drilling rates have continued to rise. 
Kansas City suggests that such volatility will likely prevent a 
strong rebound in the energy industry in the near future.
          </p>
          <p>
           San Francisco and Atlanta note an increase in lumber exports. In 
addition, imports of Canadian lumber have fallen slightly, while 
demand for southern pine remains strong.
