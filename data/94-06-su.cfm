          Districts report continued economic expansion, although in some 
areas growth has moderated recently. Contacts in a number of 
districts report slower-than-expected growth in May retail sales but 
some signs of increasing sales in early June. Manufacturing 
continued to show strength in most districts, with many contacts 
reporting increases in new orders and shipments. Defense-related 
industries, however, continue to be the weak spots. Home sales in 
most areas continued at a strong pace, and residential construction 
remains generally brisk, but some slowdowns in response to rising 
mortgage rates were noted. Industrial materials prices continue to 
rise; however, competitive pressures are mitigating price increases 
for finished goods. Some districts report tightening labor markets, 
but wage pressures appear moderate at this point. Loan demand is 
generally increasing, although rising interest rates have 
precipitated declines in some areas. Crop conditions are generally 
favorable in most agricultural areas; nevertheless, some districts 
are expressing rising concern over warm, dry weather.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Consumer Spending
          </strong>
          <br/>
          Most districts report moderate gains in retail sales, although 
contacts in the Atlanta, Cleveland, Dallas, New York and 
Philadelphia districts report slower-than-expected sales. In 
particular, they cite declines in apparel sales and attribute this 
to unseasonably cool weather. Sales activity in the Boston district 
varied from slight declines to increases of almost 20 percent over 
last year, with strong demand for outdoor-related items since 
Memorial Day. The Kansas City, Minneapolis and St. Louis districts 
report moderate-to-strong sales in general merchandise, particularly 
in apparel. The Chicago, New York, Philadelphia, Richmond and San 
Francisco districts report strong sales in household goods and 
furniture, and strength in consumer durables and other big-ticket 
items. The Atlanta, Cleveland and New York districts found that 
discounting was needed to move merchandise; the Chicago, Dallas and 
Kansas City districts note that strong competition is keeping prices 
in line. The Kansas City, Minneapolis, Philadelphia, St. Louis and 
San Francisco districts report strong auto sales; the Chicago, 
Cleveland and Dallas districts report some recent slowing in auto 
sales. A number of districts report that a shortage of popular 
models is constraining sales.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Business Activity
          </strong>
          <br/>
          Most districts report continued growth, particularly at 
manufacturing firms, although the San Francisco district has mixed 
reports from its contacts. The Chicago and St. Louis districts 
report strong growth, while the Boston, Cleveland, Minneapolis, New 
York and Richmond districts report accelerating activity. The 
Atlanta district reports a rebound of industrial production in May 
after a modest slowing in April. Machinery and heavy equipment 
orders and production are up in the Boston, Chicago, Dallas, 
Philadelphia and St. Louis districts. The San Francisco district 
says the aerospace industry, especially commercial jets, has 
stabilized, but this industry is weak in the Boston district. 
Business contacts in the St. Louis district report sales increases 
of between 10 percent and 20 percent in some instances. The Atlanta 
district reports that the demand for building materials in the 
Southeast is up recently, and that auto suppliers are receiving a
steady stream of new orders. The New York district says that its 
manufacturing contacts are more optimistic than a year ago. A survey 
of contacts in the Philadelphia and Richmond districts revealed 
increases in new orders and shipments. The Dallas and Richmond 
districts also report a steady-to-moderate increase in demand in the 
service sector, particularly at law firms, hotels and cargo 
carriers.
         </p>
         <p>
          Contacts in parts of the Kansas City, Minneapolis and St. Louis 
districts are having difficulty finding qualified employees. The St. 
Louis and San Francisco districts both repast a shortage of skilled 
construction workers. Contacts in the New York district anticipate 
few employment cuts and see wage increases of between 2 percent and 
4 percent. Contacts in the Richmond district plan no employment 
changes, but do expect to increase the average length of the 
workweek.
         </p>
         <p>
          Foreign demand for products from most districts remains somewhat 
sluggish. The Dallas and St. Louis districts, however, report some 
strengthening demand from Latin America and the Pacific Rim 
countries, respectively. In addition, the Dallas district reports 
strong chemical sales to Europe. The Kansas City district reports 
that exports are stable overall.
         </p>
         <p>
          Both the Atlanta and St. Louis districts report defense-related 
layoffs; the San Francisco district reports its defense-related 
industries remain weak. The Boston district says its durables 
producers are concerned that rising interest rates will reduce 
demand for their products, and Philadelphia district contacts are 
less optimistic now than they were at the beginning of the year.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Construction and Real Estate
          </strong>
          <br/>
          Most districts report generally strong or improving home sales, 
although many also cite increased mortgage rates as a source of 
emerging or potential weakness. Residential construction remains 
brisk in many districts, with the majority of the construction 
occurring in single-family houses. The Minneapolis district stressed 
multifamily housing as its construction strength. The Philadelphia 
district, though, reports some recent slippage in residential 
construction. The Atlanta and St. Louis districts observed rising 
house prices, while the Dallas and Richmond districts report stable 
or slightly falling house prices. Contacts in the Atlanta district 
say mid-priced homes have replaced starter homes as the big sellers, 
but low and mid-priced homes are still the big sellers in the 
Philadelphia district. The shortage of construction workers in the 
St. Louis district is adding to the already large backlogs 
previously built up because of weather delays and strong demand.
         </p>
         <p>
          The Minneapolis district reports that the commercial construction 
market is strong, and the Richmond district reports recent 
improvements in this market. The Philadelphia district, however, 
reports a soft commercial market with slightly increasing vacancy 
rates. The Boston district reports declining vacancy rates in 
Boston, although Hartford's have increased. The New York district 
reports falling vacancy rates in Manhattan, and the Richmond 
district says that vacancy rates arc falling throughout the district 
except in northern Maryland and West Virginia.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Price and Wages
          </strong>
          <br/>
          Most districts report that competitive pressures continue to temper 
price increases on the output side. Contacts in many districts 
report cost pressures on the input side-albeit modest in many 
instances. Increases in manufacturers' raw materials prices were 
noted in more than half of the districts. The Boston, Dallas and 
Philadelphia districts report increases in chemicals prices and 
certain metals prices, while the Atlanta, Kansas City, and Richmond 
districts report increases in construction materials prices. 
Tightening labor markets were noted in the Atlanta, Chicago, 
Minneapolis and Richmond districts. Nevertheless, upward pressure on 
wages, while noted by some districts, appears to be modest. In 
addition, Philadelphia reports continued increases in employment 
costs, mainly in benefits.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Banking and Finance
          </strong>
          <br/>
          Despite weakness in some areas, loan demand has generally picked up 
in most districts. Dallas reports that loan demand is up strongly, 
and San Francisco indicates similar sentiment about loan demand in 
Idaho and Utah. Business loans have reportedly increased in the 
Cleveland, Kansas City, New York, Philadelphia and St. Louis 
districts, while demand for consumer loans has risen in the Kansas 
City, Richmond and St. Louis districts. The New York district 
reports that total loan demand has subsided because of increases in 
short-term interest rates; loan demand is reported to be flat in the 
Atlanta and Philadelphia districts. Loan demand also remains weak in 
California, although the San Francisco district reports that an 
uptick in business lending has occurred in southern California and 
Hawaii. Demand for auto loans has weakened in the Atlanta and 
Cleveland districts. The Dallas, Philadelphia and San Francisco 
districts noted increased competition among lenders, leading some 
banks to offer more attractive terms to borrowers. Most other 
districts report little or no change in lending standards, although 
some report higher lending rates. For instance, the New York 
district reports that all of its surveyed banks have increased their 
rates charged on commercial and industrial loans. Despite recent 
increases in long-term rates, mortgage lending is mixed. New 
mortgage lending remains relatively strong in the Dallas, Kansas 
City and St. Louis districts, but has ebbed in the Atlanta, New 
York, Philadelphia and Richmond districts. Most districts report a 
pronounced decline in mortgage refinancing activity. After a strong 
first quarter, the Boston district reports that mutual fund sales in 
the second quarter have slowed considerably.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Agriculture and Natural Resources
          </strong>
          <br/>
          Crop conditions were generally favorable in most areas, with crop 
development and planting ahead of schedule. Richmond reports that 
some recently planted crops may have suffered from unseasonably 
warm, dry weather. Likewise, St. Louis reports increasingly drier 
conditions, and some insect problems were noted in the wheat and 
corn crops. Dallas reports that the winter wheat crop is expected to 
be off 25 percent from last year because of adverse weather. 
Minneapolis and Kansas City report adequate soil moisture with most 
crops in good-to-excellent condition. Kansas City reports that the 
recent drop in cattle prices produced feedlot losses in excess of 
$100 per head. As a result, the Kansas City district expects lower 
farm income in the livestock sector, although prospects are 
substantially more favorable for crop producers.
         </p>
         <p>
          Recent increases in crude oil prices have spurred slightly higher 
drilling activity in the Kansas City district, but little noticeable 
increase in the Dallas district. Minneapolis, on the other hand, 
reports a decrease in petroleum drilling activity in North Dakota 
and Montana. The Minneapolis and San Francisco districts report that 
lumber prices have increased, while Minneapolis indicates that 
recent increases in copper and steel prices have benefited district 
producers.
