           Beige Book
           <br/>
           National Summary
          </h2>
          <p>
           <strong>
            January 17, 1996
           </strong>
          </p>
         </center>
         <p>
          Reports from the twelve Federal Reserve Districts suggest that the 
national economy was growing at a generally modest pace at the end 
of 1995. Holiday retail sales were generally reported to be below 
expectations, with extensive discounting. Manufacturers saw uneven 
growth, with weakness noted in auto-related production. The federal 
government shutdown hurt winter tourism at national parks, but other 
areas reported increased activity. Single-family home sales are 
experiencing some seasonal slowing in most of the country. However, 
commercial real estate contacts in many areas report strengthened 
markets. Loan demand is steady in most areas. Firms say that prices 
are generally remaining stable, but some areas still report 
shortages of skilled workers.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Consumer Spending
          </strong>
          <br/>
          Retail sales during December generally fell below retailers' 
expectations, with heavy discounting the rule. However, the majority 
of retailers in the Atlanta, Kansas City, and St. Louis Districts 
experienced moderate growth over last year's levels. Reports from 
Boston, Chicago, Minneapolis, New York, Philadelphia, and San 
Francisco retail contacts indicated that year-over-year growth was 
mixed within each of these regions. According to District contacts, 
electronics, computers, fine jewelry, and cosmetics were the best-
selling items, while apparel sales were generally disappointing. 
According to retailers in the New York and Cleveland Districts, 
overall retail sales suffered because of harsh weather; however, 
hardware stores got a boost from high demand for snow-related 
equipment. Merchants in the Atlanta, Kansas City, New York, and St. 
Louis Districts report that inventories are in line with plans. 
Overall, retailers' outlook for the first quarter is guarded, with 
retailers in the Atlanta and Kansas City Districts anticipating 
little growth year-over-year, while the St. Louis District's outlook 
is mixed. Several retailers in the Dallas District are contemplating 
scaling back new store openings, and contacts in the Boston and 
Cleveland Districts anticipate rising retail vacancy rates this 
year.
         </p>
         <p>
          Sluggish auto sales were reported in the Boston, Chicago, Cleveland, 
Kansas City, and Minneapolis Districts. Dallas was the only District 
that noted auto sales increases.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Manufacturing
          </strong>
          <br/>
          Overall factory activity was mixed, according to District reports. 
Manufacturing output growth has slowed in Atlanta, New York, 
Philadelphia, and Richmond since the last Beigebook. Atlanta, 
Chicago, and Cleveland report recent orders weakness for auto 
suppliers. New orders have fallen for heavy equipment producers in 
Minneapolis. Dallas reports weaker orders for manufacturers over the 
past six weeks and points to a slight deceleration in the rapid 
growth of semiconductor production. San Francisco also reports 
excess capacity and rising inventories among some California 
semiconductor firms, but notes that, in general, demand for 
electronic goods continues strong.
         </p>
         <p>
          Manufacturers continue to operate at high levels in Boston, Chicago, 
Cleveland, and Kansas City. Machine tool orders in Boston are above 
year-ago levels, and computer products continue to grow robustly. 
Steel orders have improved for producers in the Chicago and 
Cleveland Districts. St. Louis reports that although the pace of 
industrial activity remains relatively unchanged, new announcements 
of large plant openings will add to the District's factory payrolls. 
Atlanta contacts anticipate that rebounding home sales and 
construction will boost building material and carpet production.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Tourism and Convention Business
          </strong>
          <br/>
          The Federal Government shutdown is hurting winter business in 
national parks, according to District reports. However, an early and 
above-normal snowfall has boosted tourism in the Minneapolis and 
Richmond Districts. Visits by Europeans are up, and advance bookings 
are strong in southern and central Florida.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Real Estate and Construction
          </strong>
          <br/>
          Contacts in most Districts report a slowdown in single-family home 
sales during December mainly because of seasonal factors. However, 
home sales improved over last year in Cleveland, while sales equaled 
last year's levels in the Kansas City District and fell slightly in 
the Atlanta District. Single-family home construction in the 
Atlanta, Kansas City, and St. Louis Districts fell slightly behind 
last year's levels and equaled last year in Cleveland. Atlanta, 
Chicago, and Kansas City District Realtors report tight home 
inventories in several markets. Both Atlanta and Kansas City 
District contacts report rising home prices, while Richmond contacts 
reported declines. Real estate contacts in the Atlanta and Chicago 
Districts are optimistic going into 1996, while contacts in the 
Minnesota District anticipate building will be somewhat less.
         </p>
         <p>
          Nationally, commercial real estate contacts report improving 
markets. Real estate agents in the Atlanta, Kansas City, and New 
York Districts report that new multifamily construction and 
conversion is strong. However, reports from the Dallas District 
indicate that worries about overbuilding are causing developers to 
curtail plans for new projects. Contacts in the Atlanta and Dallas 
Districts report that build-to-suit projects dominate nonresidential 
construction activity. Office vacancy rates continue to decline in 
the Atlanta, Chicago, Richmond, and Dallas Districts; however, 
downtown Boston and midtown Manhattan have shown little improvement 
recently. Overall, commercial real estate contacts report a positive 
outlook.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Financial Services
          </strong>
          <br/>
          Loan demand appears to be steady, according to reports from most 
Districts. In general, loan demand is stronger from businesses than 
from consumers. Refinancing activity has increased for all loan 
types. Banks say that, although credit quality remains very good, 
delinquencies have increased modestly in the majority of Districts. 
Contacts in the Atlanta and New York Districts report weaker 
consumer loan demand since the last Beigebook; but in southern 
California, as well as in the Cleveland, Dallas, and St. Louis 
Districts, stronger demand was noted. On the commercial side, loan 
demand was reported as strong in the Atlanta, Chicago, Cleveland, 
Dallas, and St. Louis Districts. Only the Richmond District noted 
weaker commercial loan demand.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Agriculture and Forest Products
          </strong>
          <br/>
          Agricultural conditions across the U.S. were, for the most part, 
reported to be normal for the season. Notable exceptions include the 
Dallas and Kansas City Districts where dry weather and insect damage 
have hurt the winter wheat crops. The St. Louis, Minneapolis, and 
San Francisco Districts reported slower lumber and forest product 
production.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Wages and Prices
          </strong>
          <br/>
          Boston, Dallas, Kansas City, Chicago, Richmond, and San Francisco 
report some shortages of skilled labor. Manufacturers in Dallas say 
that lack of skilled workers is a major concern, and wage pressures 
remain prevalent. In Chicago, placement specialists note a high 
number of unfilled orders for permanent and temporary employees. 
Most manufacturers report modest wage and salary increases. Some 
Districts, such as Boston, report few or reduced cost pressures. 
There are scattered reports of increasing materials prices in some 
Districts, but prices remain generally stable, according to their 
contacts.
