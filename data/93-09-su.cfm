           Slow to moderate growth characterized economic conditions in most 
Federal Reserve districts in late July and in August. 
Geographically, economic growth appears weaker on the East and West 
coasts while central areas such as Cleveland, Dallas, Kansas City 
and Minneapolis report stronger than average growth. Employment 
continues to grow slowly in spite of large companies' continued 
efforts to restructure and cut labor costs. Manufacturing reportedly 
is improving in several districts. Home construction is strong in 
many districts compared to a year ago, and a few see some 
improvement in commercial real estate markets. In agriculture, 
several districts describe weather-related damage to cops but note 
generally favorable conditions for livestock producers. Mining shows 
little overall change, but there is some increase in oil and gas 
exploration. Small increases in loans are noted in some districts, 
and some business lending rates reportedly have fallen. General 
retail sales show a mixed pattern, with strength in several 
districts but weakness in the remainder. Auto sales are strong in 
most districts. Tourism is a bright spot for some districts. With 
the exception of lumber, prices are generally stable and there is 
little evidence of inflationary cost pressures.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Labor Markets
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Continued corporate restructuring is taking the bloom off employment 
growth. Cleveland indicates that several manufacturers emphasize 
near-term revival in employment growth is unlikely, since curbing 
labor costs appears to be the favored option for improving profits 
in view of uncertainty over sales. Several large firms in the 
Minneapolis and New York districts recently have announced sizable 
layoffs. Boston and Philadelphia look for no change in manufacturing 
employment, and Richmond foresees a decline. In the St Louis 
district flooding is still keeping some people from working.
          </p>
          <p>
           But some districts also state that labor markets may be reviving. 
Several manufacturers, according to Dallas, have boosted employment, 
and in the Cleveland district retailers report cautious hiring. Some 
Minneapolis district firms have recently added workers. Moreover, 
even though employment has continued to decline in the New York 
district, the recent pace of decline has been modest.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Manufacturing
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Manufacturing production and sales are increasing in many districts. 
Several districts report strong sales for firms making building 
materials or construction-related items. Boston notes double-digit 
sales increases for automotive and electronics products compared to 
year-earlier levels. Cleveland reports a surge in appliance 
production and indicates that sheet steel and heavy truck 
manufacturers are operating at capacity. Chicago also notes very 
strong heavy truck sales along with strong light vehicle assembly. 
St. Louis lists improved business for petroleum equipment and 
apparel. Dallas also notes improvements in oil field equipment, in 
addition to strong orders for semiconductors and telecommunication 
devices. San Francisco describes improvements in semiconductors and 
electronics. Respondents to a Richmond survey of manufacturers are 
optimistic about prospects for the next six months.
          </p>
          <p>
           The situation for some products varies by location. Dallas, 
Minneapolis and San Francisco have positive comments about food 
processors, but Boston reports food manufacturing output as flat. 
Similarly, Atlanta, St. Louis and San Francisco see strength in the 
furniture industry, which is described as flat for Boston. Textile 
sales are reportedly declining for Atlanta and Boston, but higher in 
California.
          </p>
          <p>
           In the Atlanta, Boston and San Francisco districts the aerospace and 
defense industries are still weak, as are chemicals and petroleum 
for Dallas.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Construction and Real Estate
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Home construction is improving in many regions. For Dallas and 
Minneapolis, residential construction is strong. Home building 
reportedly is picking up momentum for St. Louis, and sales and 
permits rose for Richmond, particularly in the Carolinas. While 
housing starts for Kansas City were slightly below year-ago levels, 
they are rising and expected to continue to increase. San Francisco 
describes regionally mixed conditions, with strong construction in 
Arizona, Idaho, Oregon and Utah, but relative weakness in 
California, Hawaii and Washington. New York notes no change in home-
building activity, and Philadelphia describes the pace of 
construction and sales as about even with last year. In non-
residential construction, Minneapolis reports strong commercial and 
public building across its district.
          </p>
          <p>
           Boston and New York see some improvement in commercial real estate 
markets. New York describes the sale of a new, large office building 
as eliciting greater than expected interest and selling for a higher 
price than expected. According to Richmond, commercial real estate 
markets have improved in Virginia and the Carolinas but are slow 
elsewhere. For Philadelphia, commercial real estate is stagnant.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Agriculture, Mining and Energy
           </strong>
           <br/>
           It is either too wet or too dry for normal crop development, 
according to reports from several districts. Continued drought has 
damaged corn, sorghum, tobacco and other crops as well as pastures 
in the Dallas and Richmond districts and in southern portions of the 
St. Louis district. On the other hand, flooding and excess moisture 
are the principal problems for Chicago, Kansas City and Minneapolis. 
These districts report substantial damage to corn, soybean and 
spring wheat crops. Slow crop development caused by unseasonably 
cool, wet weather has left many crops in the Midwest vulnerable to 
damage from early frosts.
          </p>
          <p>
           But some positive crop developments are also noted. Scattered rains 
brought relief for some crops in Richmond's area, while Dallas 
reports good cotton crops in west and northwest Texas and estimates 
that overall crop output will be up from last year, in spite of dry 
conditions. Winter wheat production is good for Kansas City and 
excellent for the Minneapolis district. Cotton and peanuts in 
Oklahoma are reportedly in good condition. And San Francisco reports 
generally favorable agricultural output. The livestock sector is 
generally better than crops, with favorable range conditions in most 
areas and strong prices. Kansas City notes that cattle feeders 
reduced inventories somewhat in response to higher feed costs.
          </p>
          <p>
           According to San Francisco, new mines are opening in Nevada in 
response to higher gold prices. An existing gold operation in South 
Dakota is contemplating expansion. Mining is stable for Minneapolis, 
though a strike at four iron mines in August cast a cloud over 
increased production in that sector. Dallas reports rising oil and 
gas drilling rig counts compared to earlier in the year and 
describes activity in the Gulf of Mexico as very strong. Kansas City 
also notes that drilling rig numbers continue to rise and are 
substantially above 1992 levels. St. Louis reports that lumber 
producers are rebuilding inventories.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Financial Institutions and Credit
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Most districts report slight increases in loan volumes. Consumer 
borrowing and mortgage financing are up modestly in Atlanta, 
Chicago, Cleveland, Dallas, Kansas City, Philadelphia, Richmond and 
parts of the San Francisco district. Mortgage refinancing is 
especially strong in Atlanta, Philadelphia and Richmond.
          </p>
          <p>
           Commercial and industrial loans, however, are generally flat across 
the country, though there are signs of improvement. Philadelphia 
reports that business loans may increase as previously postponed 
projects are reviewed. Loan volumes in California continue to 
decrease, though at a slower pace than in recent months. Chicago and 
Dallas observe that increased competition among banks in their 
districts is bringing down rates for prospective borrowers, and New 
York notes that about half of surveyed loan officers report 
moderately lower rates.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Consumer Spending and Tourism
           </strong>
           <br/>
           General retail sales are strong in several districts, but weak in 
the remainder. For Cleveland, durable goods are moving well. Several 
retailers in the Kansas City and St. Louis districts report moderate 
increases in sales over last year. In California and New York sales 
are flat and mixed respectively. However, sales are unseasonably 
slow for Atlanta and Boston, and Minneapolis indicates that strength 
earlier in the year has ebbed somewhat. Boston, Chicago, Cleveland, 
Dallas and Richmond report that retail inventories have returned to 
satisfactory levels.
          </p>
          <p>
           Auto sales are strong in most districts. Cleveland notes that 
dealers of domestic new cars and light trucks enjoyed the best 
summer sales in more than five years. St. Louis car dealers report 
that sales of new and used domestic cars are up, in many cases by 10 
percent. In the Philadelphia district, auto sales are running above 
year-earlier levels, while Minneapolis characterizes them as stable. 
While domestic auto sales have climbed, import sales, especially of 
Japanese cars, have dropped according to Cleveland and St. Louis.
          </p>
          <p>
           Tourism is cited as a bright spot for several districts. Chicago, 
Minneapolis and Richmond report strong summer seasons. According to 
San Francisco, Idaho and Utah are enjoying record years, but 
Hawaii's visitor industry has slumped.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Prices
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Atlanta, Boston, Dallas and Kansas City report little or no change 
in prices. Food prices, according to Minneapolis, are stable, and 
gasoline prices continue below year-earlier levels Boston and Kansas 
City say retail prices are holding steady, and Dallas states strong 
competition has been restraining retail price increases. While 
Kansas City area manufacturers indicate input prices are modestly 
higher than a year ago, Atlanta's factory contacts report stable 
prices for both raw materials and finished goods. Prices are even 
flat for manufacturers in strong markets, Boston observes.
          </p>
          <p>
           Lumber is an exception to this pattern of stable prices. In the 
Atlanta district, home builders note lumber prices are beginning to 
rise again in anticipation of increased demand from rebuilding in 
Midwestern flood areas. Lumber prices, San Francisco says, are up 
about 30 percent from a year ago.
