          Overall, the U. S. economy continues its excellent performance.   
  Output and employment are high while inflation is low. The economy   
  continues to grow in all Federal Reserve districts and across most   
  sectors. The pace of growth has varied across Federal Reserve   
  districts, ranging from quite strong in the Northeast, much of the   
  Midwest and the West Coast, to somewhat more modest growth in the   
  Southeast and in the Dallas district. Growth is fueled by liberal
          <br/>
          consumer spending and by business investment in plants and
          <br/>
          equipment. The construction sector is very strong. Manufacturing is   
  robust in several districts, notably Chicago, St. Louis and Kansas   
  City, but somewhat weaker in an arc from Dallas through Atlanta and   
  Richmond.

          <span class="content">
           In agriculture, crop conditions are generally favorable, but crop 
    and livestock prices are low. Oil and gas drilling continues slack, 
    while output in other natural resource industries is generally 
    stable. Seven districts report some adverse effects from economic 
    problems in Asia.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           <strong>
            Household Spending
           </strong>
           <br/>
           The strength of the nation's economy is reflected in household 
    spending. Boston reports 5 percent to 8 percent growth over year-earlier retail sales, while New York and Chicago describe them as 
    above-plan or above expectations. Philadelphia and Richmond describe 
    sales as healthy, Minneapolis as brisk, Kansas City and San 
    Francisco as robust and Dallas as strong. Atlanta sees somewhat 
    softer consumer spending, with most retailers saying "recent sales 
    had gone as planned, but a significant minority noted their 
    disappointment." In the Chicago district spending increased 
    modestly, with sales exceeding retailers' expectations, while for 
    St. Louis average sales are up 2 percent to 2.5 percent.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           The composition of consumer spending varies somewhat by region. 
    Home furnishings and related goods are strong in several districts. 
    Summer clothing and other apparel are strong in the Midwest, but 
    mixed in New York. Motor vehicles are selling well in San Francisco, 
    Philadelphia, Richmond, Kansas City and Chicago, but more slowly for 
    Dallas and in rural parts of the Minneapolis district. St. Louis was 
    one of several districts to note the effects of strong incentive
           <br/>
           programs on auto sales. Sport utility and luxury vehicles continue 
    to sell more strongly than other models in many areas.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Tourism is strong in Boston, New York City and the Carolinas. 
    Atlanta expects a very good season in Florida and notes record 
    business at Mississippi casinos. Minneapolis district tourist 
    businesses also anticipate a good summer season. San Francisco 
    reports good tourist trade at present but anticipates some falling 
    off in October.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           <strong>
            Construction and Real Estate
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Construction is an engine of growth in many districts. Boston, New 
    York, Minneapolis, St. Louis, Kansas City and Dallas all report 
    vigorous home building. Cleveland notes a continued overall strong 
    sector, with residential building up across its district but mixed 
    activity in nonresidential categories. Home building is very strong 
    in California, but softer in Oregon and Utah. Chicago's construction 
    sector is bolstered by strong commercial building activity.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Several districts report strong market activity for existing real 
    estate, both residential and commercial. Richmond relates that 
    residential and commercial business was strong, but the pace of 
    growth was moderating. Minneapolis notes that long waits for newly 
    constructed homes are fueling interest in existing housing. Chicago 
    and New York report tighter markets for office space in contrast to 
    some softening in Philadelphia.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           <strong>
            Manufacturing
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Manufacturing generally is growing strongly, particularly in the 
    Northeast and Midwest but at a somewhat slower pace elsewhere. 
    Chicago describes particularly robust manufacturing, especially in 
    heavy equipment, appliances and steel. St. Louis reports vigorous 
    activity, while Boston lists double-digit sales gains for aircraft 
    components, power equipment, and medical and pharmaceutical 
    equipment. Philadelphia notes continued gains, and Kansas City
           <br/>
           says plants are operating at a high level of capacity. Minneapolis 
    describes manufacturing growth as strong but not spectacular. 
    Cleveland says that production is expanding at a slower pace than 
    earlier in the year.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           In contrast, manufacturing growth appears somewhat slower across 
    the Southeast and South. Richmond says that shipments have declined 
    recently and new orders are more modest. For Atlanta, production has 
    increased but expectations reportedly are for some softening. Dallas
           <br/>
           similarly reports a slightly slower manufacturing sector, driven 
    in part by sluggishness in the energy industry. But demand for 
    construction-related goods in the Dallas district is so strong that 
    items such as drywall and concrete are being rationed by suppliers. 
    San Francisco notes expanded output overall, but deceleration for 
    some products, particularly those affected by slack demand in Asia.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           <strong>
            Agriculture
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Conditions for farmers vary widely depending on region and crop or 
    livestock enterprise. Crop conditions are good in most areas, 
    especially the corn and soybean areas of the Chicago, St. Louis and 
    Minneapolis districts. Kansas City anticipates excellent winter 
    wheat yields on a somewhat reduced acreage from a year earlier. 
    Richmond also anticipates good yields for its grain producers. 
    Exceptions to this general pattern are wheat growing areas of 
    Montana and the Dakotas, where drought is a concern as it is for 
    some Dallas district farmers. Cleveland notes mold problems for 
    Kentucky tobacco growers as well as a short wheat crop there. 
    Moreover cold, wet weather has hampered some fruit production in 
    California and the Carolinas. Crop prices remain depressed in 
    response to anticipated strong yields and weak export demand.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Low cattle and hog prices are putting pressure on producers' bottom 
    lines, although Chicago notes some recent improvement in hog prices 
    from lows experienced earlier in the year. San Francisco and Kansas 
    City report that cattle feeders are losing money.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           <strong>
            Other Natural Resource Industries
           </strong>
           <br/>
           All districts reporting on oil and gas drilling describe it as
           <br/>
           slack. Dallas notes further slowing of drilling due to large stocks 
    of gas and oil. The energy sector is also weak in the Minneapolis 
    district, with gas somewhat better than oil. Kansas City reports a 
    slight uptick, though activity remains well below year-earlier 
    levels.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Iron mining sources in the Minneapolis district indicate that 1998 
    output should match the strong pace set in 1997. Forest product 
    output apparently is stable. Paper manufacturing reports are mixed, 
    with Minneapolis describing profitability varying among grades of 
    paper and Dallas noting increased pulp imports. For Atlanta, mills 
    are still operating below capacity, but with some improvement.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           <strong>
            Banking and Insurance
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Banks and other financial firms are generally in good shape. San 
    Francisco reports stronger demand for loans by businesses than by 
    consumers. Dallas sees increased consumer borrowing, except for auto 
    loans. Kansas City describes higher lending to consumers and 
    agriculture. Minneapolis says that while loan volumes continue to 
    grow, the growth rate has slowed somewhat, and lenders are becoming 
    somewhat more cautious. Bankers in the St. Louis district reportedly 
    describe loan demand and competition as strong. Lending to consumers 
    and businesses in the Chicago district is apparently very brisk, and 
    loan quality may be improving. Banks' loan business is also strong 
    in Richmond, Philadelphia and New York. Boston describes slack 
    demand for traditional life insurance, but increasing interest in 
    lines such as group disability policies as employers increase
    employee benefits.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           <strong>
            Employment, Wages and Prices
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Employment levels are high and labor markets tight in most areas. 
    While no district reports widespread increases in general wage 
    levels, reports of increases in occupation-specific, targeted or 
    nonwage compensation are frequent. Boston, Atlanta, Cleveland and 
    Chicago cite acute shortages of information technology workers and 
    say that some jobs are going unfilled. Boston notes that tight labor 
    markets are not yet leading to sizable wage hikes but says that 
    temporary employment firms are expanding sharply. Cleveland reports 
    some acceleration in compensation costs amid indications of tight 
    labor markets. Richmond says that demand for workers remains intense 
    but overall wage pressures are still mild. Similarly, Atlanta 
    describes labor shortages as plaguing parts of its district, but 
    with little upward wage pressures. Chicago sees signs of broad-based 
    labor shortages, with wages rising in specific occupations and at 
    the lower end of the pay scale, but reports that general wage 
    pressures are still subdued. Demand for labor remains strong in the 
    St. Louis district, with some upward pressure on wages noted. 
    Minneapolis continues to have very tight labor markets with 
    widespread nonwage compensation increases despite overall restraint 
    of base wage increases. Kansas City reports continued, but not 
    increasing, moderate wage pressures in very tight labor markets. 
    Dallas made note of firms' widespread difficulty in hiring skilled 
    workers and their use of targeted wage increases.
    Construction 
    workers are in short supply in the San Francisco Bay area, though 
    there is some easing of employment among high-tech manufacturers.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Despite indications of tight labor markets in all districts and
           <br/>
           higher compensation costs in several, prices of goods are largely 
    stable. Boston and New York report manufacturing input costs as flat 
    or down. New York purchasing managers see upward pressure on 
    contracted services, with most firms reporting unchanged input and 
    output prices. Cleveland and Atlanta note largely stable commodity, 
    input and finished goods prices. Minneapolis says that commodity and 
    energy prices are holding down increases in the general price level.
           <br/>
           Price changes are mixed in the Dallas district, with the
           <br/>
           preponderance lower. San Francisco cites some cost increases for 
    services.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           <strong>
            Inventories
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Reports that mention inventories generally describe them as at 
    normal levels relative to sales. Philadelphia reports stable
           <br/>
           manufacturing order backlogs and inventories and retailers'
           <br/>
           inventories at appropriate levels. Cleveland describes some upward 
    movement in inventory levels but categorizes them as in line with 
    production levels. Atlanta views inventories as generally on target, 
    while Chicago says retail inventories are "in good shape." St. Louis 
    and Kansas City say that most retailers are managing inventories at 
    lower levels, although some auto dealers have too many cars on hand.
           <br/>
           Minneapolis notes some evidence of shorter delivery times and higher 
    supplier inventories.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           <strong>
            Asia
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Seven districts made specific note of effects from economic problems 
    in Asia. Boston says such troubles have held down some input prices 
    and reduced demand for some manufactures. New York describes 
    incipient price reductions for imported electronics and apparel. 
    Philadelphia lists declining orders from Asia for primary metals and 
    construction materials. Richmond sees more effects from import 
    competition in apparel and textiles than on exports. Chicago steel 
    producers are facing increased competition from Asia and high-tech 
    and electronics is also suffering. Dallas lists weak Asian demand 
    for petrochemicals and telecommunications gear. San Francisco 
    district producers of computer components and lumber also have seen 
    a drop in sales to Asia.
