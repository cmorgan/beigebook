           Economic activity grew slowly, 
              on balance, in late October and early November, according to information 
              received by Federal Reserve District Banks. Business conditions 
              were described as soft or sluggish in Boston, Atlanta, Chicago, 
              Minneapolis, and Dallas. Cleveland and St. Louis reported mixed 
              conditions. There was marginal improvement in Philadelphia, Kansas 
              City, and New York. Richmond and San Francisco reported continued 
              growth, but at a slower pace than in the previous survey period.

          Consumer spending varied among Federal Reserve 
              Districts. There was some improvement in general merchandise sales 
              in New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Kansas City, and 
              Dallas. Sales were weak in Chicago, Minneapolis, St. Louis, and 
              San Francisco. Auto sales have fallen in all Districts. Service 
              industry activity was generally sluggish. Manufacturing remained 
              soft in most Districts, but Philadelphia and Minneapolis noted some 
              improvement. Business capital spending in all sectors continued 
              to be limited. Commercial real estate markets continued to be slack 
              in all the Districts reporting on this sector. Residential real 
              estate remained strong, although New York, Chicago, and Dallas saw 
              some signs of easing demand for housing. Agricultural conditions 
              have been adversely affected by heavy rain and cold weather in southern 
              parts of the nation but are good elsewhere. There has been little 
              change in energy production but mining has declined. Bank lending 
              remains strong for residential real estate, but other categories 
              of lending have been lackluster.

          Labor markets continued to be soft in nearly all 
              Federal Reserve Districts, although demand for health-care workers 
              remained strong. Wage and salary pressures were subdued, but employee 
              health-care costs continued to rise sharply. Most Reserve Banks 
              reported nearly steady prices at both the consumer and producer 
              levels, with the exception of shipping charges, which have risen 
              in the wake of the West Coast port disruptions.

            Consumer Spending
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Retail sales of general merchandise varied among Federal Reserve 
              Districts in October and early November. Gains were reported in 
              New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Kansas City, and Dallas. 
              However, the increases were generally slight compared with late 
              summer and early fall. Atlanta described retail sales as mixed and 
              about even with a year ago. Chicago and Minneapolis reported weak 
              retail sales, and St. Louis and San Francisco indicated that retail 
              sales had declined from September to early November. The onset of 
              colder weather in most parts of the country boosted sales of outerwear. 
              Sales also increased for food and grocery items and small home furnishings, 
              but several Districts noted flat or declining sales of big-ticket 
              and luxury items. Discount stores posted better sales growth than 
              other types of stores in most Districts, and in New York and Philadelphia 
              retailers reported that consumers were shifting purchases to discount 
              brands.
          </span>
         </p>
         <p class="content">
          All the Districts reporting on auto sales noted 
              declines in October compared with the same month last year and compared 
              with the sales rate set during most of the year until October. The 
              slower sales rate continued in November, and some further declines 
              were noted in the Kansas City and San Francisco Districts. Dealer 
              inventories have increased. In the Philadelphia and St. Louis Districts, 
              dealers said inventories were too high, but dealers in the Chicago 
              and San Francisco Districts said inventories were not excessive 
              despite the increase.
         </p>
         <p class="content">
          Tourism activity has been mixed. Boston, Richmond, 
              Minneapolis, and Kansas City reported that recent tourist travel, 
              lodging, and spending had increased from last year in most parts 
              of their Districts. Chicago indicated flat tourism. In the Atlanta, 
              Dallas, and San Francisco Districts, travel and tourism have been 
              weaker this year than last, although Atlanta noted that advance 
              bookings for winter cruises were strong.

            Services
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Service industry activity remained weak. In Boston, demand for information 
              technology services has declined. Service companies in the Richmond 
              District have had sluggish revenue growth. Service-sector activity 
              was slow in the Dallas District, and demand for most business services 
              was said to be soft in the San Francisco District.

         <p class="content">
          Trucking firms in the St. Louis District still 
              have large backlogs resulting from the West Coast port disruptions. 
              Delays in receiving shipments were reported from Boston and Philadelphia, 
              although deliveries in those Districts appeared to be getting back 
              to normal. Atlanta-area retailers remain concerned about getting 
              all their holiday merchandise delivered before Christmas. Also in 
              the Atlanta District, Asian motor vehicles and parts have been in 
              short supply because of the West Coast shipping interruption and 
              slowdown. Dallas reported that transportation activity in the District 
              was at low levels. In Cleveland and Kansas City, there were few 
              reports of difficulties obtaining shipments.

            Manufacturing
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Most Districts reported continuing weak conditions in the manufacturing 
              sector in October and early November. Demand for manufactured goods 
              remained soft in the Boston, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, and Dallas 
              Districts. Conditions were mixed in the Cleveland, St. Louis, and 
              San Francisco Districts, although San Francisco noted an increase 
              in cancellations of orders at manufacturers in the District. Kansas 
              City reported an apparent stabilization in the District's manufacturing 
              sector in late October and early November after a decline earlier 
              in the fall. Manufacturers in the New York, Philadelphia, and Minneapolis 
              Districts reported some improvement, on balance.
          </span>
         </p>
         <p class="content">
          Conditions varied among specific goods-producing 
              sectors. Boston and Chicago indicated that capital goods industries 
              had flat or falling sales. Producers of industrial equipment were 
              seeing improved demand in the Philadelphia and Richmond Districts. 
              Philadelphia and Dallas noted declining orders for construction 
              materials. Orders at defense plants have increased according to 
              Boston and Atlanta. New York noted a fairly broad rebound in the 
              manufacturing sector. In general, manufacturers have been producing 
              below capacity, and they have been implementing cost-reduction measures 
              to maintain profitability.
         </p>
         <p class="content">
          Among the Districts reporting on manufacturing 
              inventories, there was no clear pattern. Manufacturers in the Philadelphia 
              and Cleveland Districts have reduced inventories recently. Inventories 
              remained low among manufacturers in the San Francisco District. 
              Chicago District manufacturers had recent increases in inventories 
              but generally described inventory levels as "fair."

            Capital Spending
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Business capital spending continues to be limited, according to 
              most of the Reserve Banks reporting on this activity. In the Boston 
              District, retailers generally plan little if any increases for 2003, 
              manufacturers' plans are mixed, and information technology and software 
              companies will keep their capital budgets flat. In the Richmond 
              District, retailers' plans are mixed, although most are planning 
              upgrades to information systems next year. Manufacturers in the 
              Philadelphia District plan to increase capital spending in the next 
              six months, on balance, and there are some reports of higher capital 
              spending among manufacturers in the St. Louis District. But manufacturers 
              intend little change in capital spending in the Kansas City District 
              in the next six months, and they are delaying or canceling spending 
              in the Atlanta District.

            Real Estate and Construction
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Commercial real estate markets remained weak in all twelve Federal 
              Reserve Districts. Rising vacancies, increased subleasing, and declining 
              rents have been evident in nearly all office markets. Commercial 
              construction has also slackened. San Francisco reported that commercial 
              development has all but stopped. Commercial construction has picked 
              up in a few parts of the Richmond and St. Louis Districts, even 
              though those Districts also reported general softness in nonresidential 
              construction.
          </span>
         </p>
         <p class="content">
          Residential real estate markets continued to be 
              strong in the majority of Districts. There has been little change 
              in the pace of home sales in Philadelphia, Richmond, Atlanta, St. 
              Louis, and Kansas City. In the Cleveland District home builders 
              have been exceeding planned construction rates, and home building 
              in the Minneapolis District is ahead of last year's pace. Residential 
              real estate markets remained "solid" in San Francisco, but growth 
              of new home construction has slowed. Both San Francisco and Atlanta 
              reported some weakening in demand for homes in the higher price 
              ranges. Three Districts indicated that residential markets were 
              softening: New York, Chicago, and Dallas. In the Chicago and Dallas 
              Districts cancellations of house-construction contracts have increased.

           Recent rains in many parts of the nation have ameliorated drought 
              conditions, but heavy rains in the South have damaged some crops 
              and delayed field operations. This year's grain crops, especially 
              corn and soybeans, in the Cleveland, Chicago, and St. Louis Districts 
              are expected to be below those of recent years. The cotton crop 
              in the St. Louis District and the sugar cane crop in the Atlanta 
              District were also significantly damaged by rainstorms. In contrast, 
              farmers in the Minneapolis District expect large increases in corn, 
              soybean, and wheat production, and Dallas expects good cotton and 
              winter wheat crops.

          Federal Reserve Districts reporting on the energy sector noted little 
            change in activity in October and November. In the Minneapolis District, 
            oil and gas production rose slightly, but exploration efforts have 
            been flat. The oil and gas rig count edged up in the Kansas City District 
            but was steady in the Dallas District. According to contacts in the 
            Kansas City District natural gas inventories were high, but unusually 
            strong winter demand could outstrip production capacity. Minneapolis 
            reported that non-energy mining activity in the District had moved 
            down somewhat.

          Residential loan demand continued to be strong in most Districts for 
            both refinancings and purchase mortgages. New York, Philadelphia, 
            Cleveland, Richmond, Chicago, Kansas City, and Dallas noted continuing 
            strength or further growth in mortgage activity. However, Atlanta 
            and San Francisco reported recent slowing in mortgage activity. Commercial 
            and industrial loan demand remained soft in New York, Philadelphia, 
            Richmond, Chicago, and St. Louis. Such loan demand was said to be 
            flat in Cleveland and edging up in Kansas City. Bankers in the Philadelphia, 
            Chicago, and St. Louis Districts said business loan demand was low 
            because businesses have less interest in or need for funds, since 
            their inventories, accounts receivable, and investment spending have 
            declined. Reports of weakening consumer loan demand, other than real 
            estate related, came from New York, Philadelphia, and Dallas. Consumer 
            loan demand has strengthened somewhat in Cleveland, Chicago, and Kansas 
            City, although growth rates were not robust.

          Nearly all Reserve Banks reported continued softness in labor markets, 
            although New York indicated there were scattered signs of a pickup 
            in demand. Kansas City reported a continuing high rate of lay-off 
            announcements. Hiring at temporary employment agencies was picking 
            up, although slowly, in Boston, but growth in temporary help employment 
            had stalled in Chicago and was described as "lukewarm" in Richmond. 
            An exception to the generally flat demand for workers in most Districts 
            is the health-care sector, where the supply of available workers remains 
            below employers' needs. Retailers will hire close to the normal number 
            of seasonal employees, according to Philadelphia and Richmond, but 
            stores in Atlanta are being cautious in adding workers for the holidays.

          Wage and salary pressures remain subdued. Kansas 
            City indicated that wage pressures were virtually nonexistent. Dallas 
            noted that temporary help wages have been flat or declining. San Francisco 
            reported that many firms in that District were canceling usual year-end 
            bonuses. Although wage and salary trends have been weak, increases 
            in employee health-care costs have been large and widespread.

          Most Reserve Banks reported generally steady retail prices in November. 
            Boston indicated that retail prices for goods have been flat and that 
            hotels, restaurants, and tour companies have introduced low-priced 
            package deals. New York noted a decline in selling prices for most 
            consumer goods. Chicago and San Francisco said retail prices have 
            shown little change.

          In the industrial sector prices have changed 
            little. Manufacturers' selling prices have been flat to down, and 
            prices for software and information technology services have been 
            practically unchanged in Boston. Manufacturers' selling prices have 
            declined in New York, although input costs have risen. Manufacturers' 
            input costs and output prices have been mainly unchanged in Philadelphia. 
            Manufacturers in the Chicago District said they have little pricing 
            power.

          Minneapolis reported modest price increases 
            generally, and Dallas noted more price reductions than increases. 
            San Francisco noted that truckers, marine shipping companies, and 
            air freight companies have imposed extra charges related to shipping 
            delays occasioned by the West Coast port problems.
