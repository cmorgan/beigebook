           <strong>
            January 15, 1975

          <p align="left">
           District "Red Book" reports for mid-January generally reflect the 
  accentuation in most parts of the country of the pronounced 
  deterioration of the economy in the recent past suggested by 
  nationwide economic indicators. Retail sales in most areas over the 
  holiday season were only equal or barely above last year's level in 
  dollar terms and, given the sharp rise in retail prices over the 
  past year, lower in volume. Moreover, this year's level was achieved 
  only by dint of heavy pre-Christmas aggressive promotion, special 
  sales, and price cutting in addition to the usual early January 
  clearance sales. Against this background, a number of respondents in 
  various Districts regarded retail inventories to be relatively high 
  to excessive in relation to current sale prospects, with increased 
  reports of efforts to reduce positions, both at the retail and 
  manufacturing level. Planned business plant and equipment outlays, 
  apart from energy related industries, on balance appeared to be 
  weaker than had been expected, and a number of Districts report 
  cutbacks, or outright cancellations of planned projects. The private 
  residential construction, and to a lesser extent commercial 
  construction, picture remained bleak, although a reported moderate 
  reversal in the outflow of deposits at thrift institutions gives 
  hope that the eventual bottoming of the decline in that industry may 
  be approaching. The outlook for near term manufacturing activity 
  other than related energy industries was further dimmed by 
  widespread reports of declining new orders, shipments and backlogs.
          </p>
          <p align="left">
           <span class="content">
            Against this background, virtually all Districts report a rise in 
    the jobless rate, concentrated in the automobile and construction 
    related industries, but also widening to other economic sectors. In 
    addition, there were increased reports of rises in payment 
    delinquencies and in bankruptcies. On the brighter side were reports 
    of lessened, even vanishing, materials scarcities, of price 
    reductions of primary commodities and of downward price pressure at 
    the manufacturing and wholesale level; apart from the possibly only 
    temporary promotional price concessions mentioned above, however, 
    these reductions as yet seemed to have had limited influence on 
    retail prices generally.

            Concerning retail sales, San Francisco, among other Districts, 
  reports consumer spending in December as restrained, and while 
  retail sales rose in dollar terms, this resulted primarily from 
  vigorous efforts by retailers to draw down excessive inventories. 
  Minneapolis reports that most retailers surveyed had December sales 
  increases of only about 5 percent, in good part achieved by price 
  cutting. Philadelphia District dollar sales in December were only 
  slightly above last year's level with retailers relatively 
  pessimistic regarding the outlook for January. Cleveland describes 
  retail trade as "poor", despite a late spurt during the week prior 
  to Christmas, while Richmond finds continued weakness in the sale of 
  big ticket items. Atlanta characterizes pre-Christmas sales as very 
  good in many areas of the District, largely in response to heavy 
  promotions and price cuts. St. Louis reports that department stores' 
  dollar sales were up somewhat from a year ago, a better performance 
  than had been expected. Holiday sales in the New York District were 
  on the weak side, but no more than had been expected, and reported 
  to have been strengthening somewhat recently.

            This relatively sluggish retail sales performance for this time of 
  year finds its counterpart in excessive inventories, and in actual 
  and expected efforts to reduce stocks, at the retail and, in some 
  instances, at the manufacturing level, as reported by a number of 
  banks, including Minneapolis, Kansas City, Richmond, Cleveland, 
  Chicago and New York. Moreover, declines in new orders and backlogs 
  and increases in cancellations, as well as the virtual elimination 
  of many shortages and the appearance of surpluses of some materials 
  and finished goods, are noted by a number of banks, including 
  Philadelphia, Cleveland, Chicago, Richmond, San Francisco and 
  Dallas. Dallas, however, reports that firms supplying steel and 
  fabricated metal products to energy related industries continue to 
  be hard pressed to meet demand. Cleveland and Richmond note that 
  sharp reductions in natural gas supplies are adversely affecting 
  production.

          <p align="left">
           <span class="content">
            The well known plight of the construction industry is mentioned in a 
  number of reports. Atlanta notes, however, that owing to an 
  improving inflow of dollars to thrift institutions, funds are 
  rapidly becoming more readily available for the housing industry, 
  while Kansas City reports that several commercial banks plan to 
  commit funds for future construction. An improvement in inflows to 
  savings and loan associations is also reported by Minneapolis and 
  Chicago, but these institutions are not expected to increase loan 
  commitments until they have reduced their large borrowing and 
  increased their liquid assets.

          <p align="left">
           <span class="content">
            Over half of the reports point to evidence of a weaker capital 
  spending picture. Among others, Boston reports that orders for 
  machine tools have "all but vanished", while Cleveland and St. Louis 
  report a weakening in the sale of such items. San Francisco reports 
  more cancellations of capital projects; almost half of the 
  manufacturers surveyed by Richmond consider current plant equipment 
  excessive; and Chicago states that although producers of heavy 
  capital equipment continue to operate at capacity, backlogs are 
  declining, and in the case of heavy trucks have "dissolved".

           <span class="content">
            The unemployment picture has darkened throughout most parts of the 
  nation, although there are regional variations in the intensity of 
  the problem, ranging from "probably unprecedented since World War 
  II" in the Chicago and Detroit areas to the report by Minneapolis 
  that, while layoffs have occurred in the District, they have not 
  reached the proportions reported nationally. At the same time, there 
  were some reports of continued shortages of skilled workers and, in 
  the Dallas District, of unskilled labor as well.
