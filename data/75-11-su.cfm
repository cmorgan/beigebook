          <p align="left">
           The economy has continued to recover, according to this month's 
Redbook reports, but the recovery has been uneven due to a 
persistent sluggishness in several regions and industries. Retail 
sales improved this fall, and retailers expect a good holiday 
season. With some exceptions, manufacturing activity has improved in 
recent weeks, but building activity has remained off nationwide, and 
business loan demand has been slow in most districts. Opinions vary 
concerning effects of a possible default by New York City. Favorable 
weather conditions have resulted in better than expected crop yields 
in many areas.
          </p>
          <p>
           The nation's retailers were generally optimistic about their holiday 
sales prospects because of improved retail sales this fall. However, 
their optimism was guarded, resulting in tight inventory policies. 
Consumers were still usually characterized as "trading down" or 
hunting" and as being "quality conscious" and "exceptionally 
cautious."
          </p>
          <p>
           Retailers in the Boston and Cleveland districts experienced 
disappointing sales this fall and were therefore less optimistic 
about holiday sales than their counterparts in other districts. For 
example, a November survey by the Richmond bank indicated 
substantial sales gains and the first increase in sales of big-ticket items in over a year. Sales of big-ticket items, except 
furniture, remained weak in most other districts, while clothing was 
apparently selling well nationwide.
          </p>
          <p>
           Automobile sales presented a mixed picture,  with sales increases 
reported by St. Louis, San Francisco, and Minneapolis. The two 
latter districts also noted an improvement in truck sales. New York 
indicated that the new small cars met with a good reception, while 
the reverse was true in Kansas City. Despite a slight increase in 
new car sales, Cleveland noted a lack of enthusiasm for the new 1976 
models.
          </p>
          <p>
           Present inventory positions were regarded as satisfactory by most 
retailers, and caution had prompted only modest restocking. 
Retailers in several districts stated that they preferred the risk 
of running out of some goods rather than facing an overstocked 
position after Christmas. Prices were reportedly steady to 
increasing slightly in most districts, although retailers in 
Philadelphia noted some easing in prices.
          </p>
          <p>
           Although reports varied, manufacturing activity appeared to be 
slowly recovering. Surveys by Richmond and Philadelphia indicated 
improvement, and St. Louis, San Francisco, and Cleveland stated that 
manufacturing shipments had advanced. Other indicators also denoted 
better conditions. Richmond, for example, found that inventories had 
been brought into line with sales. Chicago, however, pointed out 
that many manufacturers were still cutting inventories but indicated 
some stocks appeared to be "approaching leanness." Philadelphia, St. 
Louis, and Richmond reported increases in manufacturing employment, 
but Chicago indicated few companies were actively hiring. 
Furthermore, while Philadelphia indicated capital expenditures by 
manufacturers were beginning to pick up, several districts said 
capital goods producers and steel producers were experiencing 
continued difficulties.
          </p>
          <p>
           Construction continued to be depressed nationwide, although St. 
Louis noted a substantial increase in building of single-family 
units. There was little evidence of a recovery in nonresidential 
construction.
          </p>
          <p>
           Most districts reported that business loan demand was slow, though 
seasonal lending needs were up in some districts. Kansas City and 
Dallas attributed flat loan demand to the moderate pace of inventory 
rebuilding, while Philadelphia cited present excess industrial 
capacity and substantial corporate liquidity. Boston and 
Philadelphia both anticipated little significant increase in loan 
demand for the next three to six months.
          </p>
          <p>
           Banks were divided in their assessments of a possible default by New 
York City. Chicago and Kansas City expected the impacts would be 
relatively minor, and many San Francisco directors felt the market 
had largely discounted the default. Boston, however, believed that a 
constructive workout prior to default would save "some anguish" and 
that the Administration had "underestimated the wrangling, chaos, 
and cash drain that default would entail." New York said its 
district was being adversely affected by the city's difficulties, 
though directors within the New York district were split in their 
assessments of the impacts of default.
          </p>
          <p>
           The nation's harvest had been nearing completion ahead of schedule 
under near-perfect weather conditions. Yields had been better than 
expected in many areas, and Dallas, Richmond, San Francisco, and 
Minneapolis were among the districts noting improved farm income 
prospects. Kansas City and Dallas stated that there had been a sharp 
upturn in cattle feeding, and Atlanta said that the movement of 
range livestock to market had been progressing at a record pace.
